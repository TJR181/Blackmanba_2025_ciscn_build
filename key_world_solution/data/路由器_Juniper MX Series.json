Devices are only vulnerable when the Suspicious Control Flow Detection (scfd) feature is enabled. Upon enabling this specific feature, an attacker sending specific traffic is causing memory to be allocated dynamically and it is not freed. Memory is not freed even after deactivating this feature. Sustained processing of such traffic will eventually lead to an out of memory condition that prevents all services from continuing to function, and requires a manual restart to recover. The FPC memory usage can be monitored using the CLI command \"show chassis fpc\". On running the above command, the memory of AftDdosScfdFlow can be observed to detect the memory leak.

When an inconsistent \"deterministic NAT\" configuration is present on an SRX, or MX with SPC3 and then a specific CLI command is issued the SPC will crash and restart. Repeated execution of this command will lead to a sustained DoS. Such a configuration is characterized by the total number of port blocks being greater than the total number of hosts.

    "漏洞描述": "A vulnerability in the processing of traffic matching a firewall filter containing a syslog action in Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MPC10/MPC11 cards installed, PTX10003 and PTX10008 Series devices, will cause the line card to crash and restart, creating a Denial of Service (DoS). Continued receipt and processing of packets matching the firewall filter can create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. When traffic hits the firewall filter, configured on lo0 or any physical interface on the line card, containing a term with a syslog action (e.g. 'term <name> then syslog'), the affected line card will crash and restart, impacting traffic processing through the ports of the line card. This issue only affects MX Series routers with MPC10 or MPC11 line cards, and PTX10003 or PTX10008 Series packet transport routers. No other platforms or models of line cards are affected by this issue. Note: This issue has also been identified and described in technical service bulletin TSB17931 (login required). This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series: 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S2; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S2; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R2-S2, 20.2R3; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2.

    "漏洞描述": "A buffer size validation vulnerability in the overlayd service of Juniper Networks Junos OS may allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to send specially crafted packets to the device, triggering a partial Denial of Service (DoS) condition, or leading to remote code execution (RCE). Continued receipt and processing of these packets will sustain the partial DoS. The overlayd daemon handles Overlay OAM packets, such as ping and traceroute, sent to the overlay. The service runs as root by default and listens for UDP connections on port 4789. This issue results from improper buffer size validation, which can lead to a buffer overflow. Unauthenticated attackers can send specially crafted packets to trigger this vulnerability, resulting in possible remote code execution. overlayd runs by default in MX Series, ACX Series, and QFX Series platforms. The SRX Series does not support VXLAN and is therefore not vulnerable to this issue. Other platforms are also vulnerable if a Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) overlay network is configured.

    "漏洞描述": "A NULL Pointer Dereference vulnerability in the Captive Portal Content Delivery (CPCD) services daemon (cpcd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MS-PIC, MS-SPC3, MS-MIC or MS-MPC allows an attacker to send malformed HTTP packets to the device thereby causing a Denial of Service (DoS), crashing the Multiservices PIC Management Daemon (mspmand) process thereby denying users the ability to login, while concurrently impacting other mspmand services and traffic through the device. Continued receipt and processing of these malformed packets will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. While the Services PIC is restarting, all PIC services will be bypassed until the Services PIC completes its boot process.

    "漏洞描述": "On Juniper Networks MX Series with MS-MIC or MS-MPC card configured with NAT64 configuration, receipt of a malformed IPv6 packet may crash the MS-PIC component on MS-MIC or MS-MPC. This issue occurs when a multiservice card is translating the malformed IPv6 packet to IPv4 packet. An unauthenticated attacker can continuously send crafted IPv6 packets through the device causing repetitive MS-PIC process crashes, resulting in an extended Denial of Service condition.

    "CVE编号": "CVE-2020-1633",
    "漏洞描述": "Due to a new NDP proxy feature for EVPN leaf nodes introduced in Junos OS 17.4, crafted NDPv6 packets could transit a Junos device configured as a Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) and reach the EVPN leaf node, causing a stale MAC address entry. This could cause legitimate traffic to be discarded, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue only affects Junos OS 17.4 and later releases. Prior releases do not support this feature and are unaffected by this vulnerability. This issue only affects IPv6. IPv4 ARP proxy is unaffected by this vulnerability. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS: 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S9, 17.4R3 on MX Series; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S9 on MX Series; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R2-S7, 18.2R3-S3 on MX Series; 18.2X75 versions prior to 18.2X75-D33, 18.2X75-D411, 18.2X75-D420, 18.2X75-D60 on MX Series; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R1-S7, 18.3R2-S3, 18.3R3 on MX Series; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S5, 18.4R2-S2, 18.4R3 on MX Series; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R1-S4, 19.1R2 on MX Series; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S3, 19.2R2 on MX Series.",

    "漏洞描述": "A privilege escalation vulnerability in Juniper Networks QFX10K Series, EX9200 Series, MX Series, and PTX Series with Next-Generation Routing Engine (NG-RE), allows a local authenticated high privileged user to access the underlying WRL host. This issue only affects QFX10K Series with NG-RE, EX9200 Series with NG-RE, MX Series with NG-RE and PTX Series with NG-RE; which uses vmhost.

To identify whether the device has NG-RE with vmhost, customer can run the following command: > show vmhost status Compute cluster: rainier-re-cc Compute Node: rainier-re-cn, Online If the \"show vmhost status\" is not supported, then the device does not have NG-RE with vmhost.",
