Since step 2 is asynchronous, cfg80211 may not have completed\nhandling the new channel list, which may leading to an out-of-bounds\nwrite error:\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in ath11k_reg_update_chan_list\nCall Trace:\n    ath11k_reg_update_chan_list+0xbfe/0xfe0 [ath11k]\n    kfree+0x109/0x3a0\n    ath11k_regd_update+0x1cf/0x350 [ath11k]\n    ath11k_regd_update_work+0x14/0x20 [ath11k]\n    process_one_work+0xe35/0x14c0\n\nShould ensure step 2 is completely done before executing step 3.

    "漏洞描述": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: cfg80211: regulatory: improve invalid hints checking\n\nSyzbot keeps reporting an issue [1] that occurs when erroneous symbols\nsent from userspace get through into user_alpha2[] via\nregulatory_hint_user() call. Such invalid regulatory hints should be\nrejected.\n\nWhile a sanity check from commit 47caf685a685 (\"cfg80211: regulatory:\nreject invalid hints\") looks to be enough to deter these very cases,\nthere is a way to get around it due to 2 reasons.\n\n1) The way isalpha() works, symbols other than latin lower and\nupper letters may be used to determine a country/domain.\nFor instance, greek letters will also be considered upper/lower\nletters and for such characters isalpha() will return true as well.\nHowever, ISO-3166-1 alpha2 codes should only hold latin\ncharacters.\n\n2) While processing a user regulatory request, between\nreg_process_hint_user() and regulatory_hint_user() there happens to\nbe a call to queue_regulatory_request() which modifies letters in\nrequest->alpha2[] with toupper(). This works fine for latin symbols,\nless so for weird letter characters from the second part of _ctype[].\n\nSyzbot triggers a warning in is_user_regdom_saved() by first sending\nover an unexpected non-latin letter that gets malformed by toupper()\ninto a character that ends up failing isalpha() check.\n\nPrevent this by enhancing is_an_alpha2() to ensure that incoming\nsymbols are latin letters and nothing else.\n\n[1] Syzbot report:\n------------[ cut here ]------------\nUnexpected user alpha2: A�\nWARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 964 at net/wireless/reg.c:442 is_user_regdom_saved net/wireless/reg.c:440 [inline]\nWARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 964 at net/wireless/reg.c:442 restore_alpha2 net/wireless/reg.c:3424 [inline]\nWARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 964 at net/wireless/reg.c:442 restore_regulatory_settings+0x3c0/0x1e50 net/wireless/reg.c:3516\nModules linked in:\nCPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 964 Comm: kworker/1:2 Not tainted 6.12.0-rc5-syzkaller-00044-gc1e939a21eb1 #0\nHardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 09/13/2024\nWorkqueue: events_power_efficient crda_timeout_work\nRIP: 0010:is_user_regdom_saved net/wireless/reg.c:440 [inline]\nRIP: 0010:restore_alpha2 net/wireless/reg.c:3424 [inline]\nRIP: 0010:restore_regulatory_settings+0x3c0/0x1e50 net/wireless/reg.c:3516\n...\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n crda_timeout_work+0x27/0x50 net/wireless/reg.c:542\n process_one_work kernel/workqueue.c:3229 [inline]\n process_scheduled_works+0xa65/0x1850 kernel/workqueue.c:3310\n worker_thread+0x870/0xd30 kernel/workqueue.c:3391\n kthread+0x2f2/0x390 kernel/kthread.c:389\n ret_from_fork+0x4d/0x80 arch/x86/kernel/process.c:147\n ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30 arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:244\n </TASK>",

The victim is not required to join a game session with an attacker. The victim must open the \"Wireless Play\" (or \"LAN Play\") menu from the game's title screen, and an attacker nearby (LDN) or on the same LAN network as the victim can send a crafted reply packet to the victim's console. This enables a remote attacker to obtain complete denial-of-service on the game's process, or potentially, remote code execution on the victim's console.

When unregistering a net device, since the needs_free_netdev has\nbeen set to true during registration, the netdevice object is also freed,\nand as a consequence, the corresponding vif object too, since it is\nattached to it as private netdevice data. The next occurrence of the loop\nthen tries to access freed vif pointer to the list to move forward in the\nlist.\n\nFix this use-after-free thanks to two mechanisms:\n- navigate in the list with list_for_each_entry_safe, which allows to\n  safely modify the list as we go through each element. For each element,\n  remove it from the list with list_del_rcu\n- make sure to wait for RCU grace period end after each vif removal to make\n  sure it is safe to free the corresponding vif too (through\n  unregister_netdev)\n\nSince we are in a RCU \"modifier\" path (not a \"reader\" path), and because\nsuch path is expected not to be concurrent to any other modifier (we are\nusing the vif_mutex lock), we do not need to use RCU list API, that's why\nwe can benefit from list_for_each_entry_safe.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-wireless/ab077dbe58b1ea5de0a3b2ca21f275a07af967d2.camel@egauge.net/",

In summary this happened:\n\nAfter updating wpa_supplicant from 2.9 to 2.10 the kernel crashed with a\n\"divide error: 0000\" when connecting to an AP. Control port tx now tries to\nuse IEEE80211_AC_VO for the priority, which wpa_supplicants starts to use in\n2.10.\n\nSince only the rtl8187se part of the driver supports QoS, the priority\nof the skb is set to IEEE80211_AC_BE (2) by mac80211 for rtl8180/rtl8185\ncards.\n\nrtl8180 is then unconditionally reading out the priority and finally crashes on\ndrivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtl818x/rtl8180/dev.c line 544 without this\npatch:\n\tidx = (ring->idx + skb_queue_len(&ring->queue)) % ring->entries\n\n\"ring->entries\" is zero for rtl8180/rtl8185 cards, tx_ring[2] never got\ninitialized.",

With this\nkernel version, -EPROBE_DEFER is returned the first time\ndsps_setup_optional_vbus_irq() is called which triggers the probe to\nerror out without unregistering the platform device. Unfortunately, on\nthe Beagle Bone Black Wireless, the platform device still living in the\nsystem is being used by the USB Ethernet gadget driver, which during the\nboot phase triggers the crash.\n\nMy limited knowledge of the musb world prevents me to revert this commit\nwhich was sent to silence a robot warning which, as far as I understand,\ndoes not make sense. The goal of this patch was to prevent an IRQ to\nfire before the platform device being registered. I think this cannot\never happen due to the fact that enabling the interrupts is done by the\n->enable() callback of the platform musb device, and this platform\ndevice must be already registered in order for the core or any other\nuser to use this callback.\n\nHence, I decided to fix the error path, which might prevent future\nerrors on mainline kernels while also fixing older ones.",

    "漏洞描述": "A vulnerability in the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) protocol processing of Cisco IOS XE Wireless Controller Software for the Cisco Catalyst 9000 Family Wireless Controllers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of CAPWAP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed CAPWAP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to crash and reload, resulting in a DoS condition.",

    "漏洞描述": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco RV132W ADSL2+ Wireless-N VPN Routers and Cisco RV134W VDSL2 Wireless-AC VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device or cause the device to restart unexpectedly. The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system or cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.",

    "漏洞描述": "This vulnerability applies to the Micro Air Vehicle Link (MAVLink) protocol and allows a remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information provided it has access to the communication medium. MAVLink is a header-based protocol that does not perform encryption to improve transfer (and reception speed) and efficiency by design. The increasing popularity of the protocol (used accross different autopilots) has led to its use in wired and wireless mediums through insecure communication channels exposing sensitive information to a remote attacker with ability to intercept network traffic.",

    "漏洞描述": "MiR100, MiR200 and other MiR robots use the Robot Operating System (ROS) default packages exposing the computational graph to all network interfaces, wireless and wired. This is the result of a bad set up and can be mitigated by appropriately configuring ROS and/or applying custom patches as appropriate. Currently, the ROS computational graph can be accessed fully from the wired exposed ports. In combination with other flaws such as CVE-2020-10269, the computation graph can also be fetched and interacted from wireless networks. This allows a malicious operator to take control of the ROS logic and correspondingly, the complete robot given that MiR's operations are centered around the framework (ROS).",

Credentials to such wireless interface default to well known and widely spread users (omitted) and passwords (omitted). This information is also available in past User Guides and manuals which the vendor distributed. This flaw allows cyber attackers to take control of the robot remotely and make use of the default user interfaces MiR has created, lowering the complexity of attacks and making them available to entry-level attackers. More elaborated attacks can also be established by clearing authentication and sending network requests directly. We have confirmed this flaw in MiR100 and MiR200 but according to the vendor, it might also apply to MiR250, MiR500 and MiR1000.",
