    "漏洞描述": "Claude Code is an agentic coding tool. Claude Code extensions in VSCode and forks (e.g., Cursor, Windsurf, and VSCodium) and JetBrains IDEs (e.g., IntelliJ, Pycharm, and Android Studio) are vulnerable to unauthorized websocket connections from an attacker when visiting attacker-controlled webpages. Claude Code for VSCode IDE extensions versions 0.2.116 through 1.0.23 are vulnerable. For Jetbrains IDE plugins, Claude Code [beta] versions 0.1.1 through 0.1.8 are vulnerable. In VSCode (and forks), exploitation would allow an attacker to read arbitrary files, see the list of files open in the IDE, get selection and diagnostics events from the IDE, or execute code in limited situations where a user has an open Jupyter Notebook and accepts a malicious prompt. In JetBrains IDEs, an attacker could get selection events, a list of open files, and a list of syntax errors. Claude released a patch for this issue on June 13th, 2025. Although Claude Code auto-updates when a user launch it and auto-updates the extensions, users should take the following steps, though the exact steps depend on one's integrated development environment (IDE). For VSCode, Cursor, Windsurf, VSCodium, and other VSCode forks, check the extension Claude Code for VSCode. Open the list of Extensions (View->Extensions), look for Claude Code for VSCode among installed extensions, update or uninstall any version prior to 1.0.24, and restart the IDE. For JetBrains IDEs including IntelliJ, PyCharm, and Android Studio, check the plugin Claude Code [Beta]. Open the Plugins list, look for Claude Code [Beta] among installed extensions, update or uninstall any version prior to 0.1.9, and restart the IDE.",

The adapter uses JWT for authentication, but lacks proper signer and issuer validation. In deployments of ALB that ignore security best practices, where ALB targets are directly exposed to internet traffic, an actor can provide a JWT signed by an untrusted entity in order to spoof OIDC-federated sessions and successfully bypass authentication.\n\n\n\nThe repository/package has been deprecated, is end of life, and is no longer supported. As a security best practice, ensure that your ELB targets (e.g. EC2 Instances, Fargate Tasks etc.) do not have public IP addresses. Ensure any forked or derivative code validate that the signer attribute in the JWT match the ARN of the Application Load Balancer that the service is configured to use.",

    "漏洞描述": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: Restrict CPU_BIG_ENDIAN to GNU as or LLVM IAS 15.x or newer\n\nPrior to LLVM 15.0.0, LLVM's integrated assembler would incorrectly\nbyte-swap NOP when compiling for big-endian, and the resulting series of\nbytes happened to match the encoding of FNMADD S21, S30, S0, S0.\n\nThis went unnoticed until commit:\n\n  34f66c4c4d5518c1 (\"arm64: Use a positive cpucap for FP/SIMD\")\n\nPrior to that commit, the kernel would always enable the use of FPSIMD\nearly in boot when __cpu_setup() initialized CPACR_EL1, and so usage of\nFNMADD within the kernel was not detected, but could result in the\ncorruption of user or kernel FPSIMD state.\n\nAfter that commit, the instructions happen to trap during boot prior to\nFPSIMD being detected and enabled, e.g.\n\n| Unhandled 64-bit el1h sync exception on CPU0, ESR 0x000000001fe00000 -- ASIMD\n| CPU: 0 PID: 0 Comm: swapper Not tainted 6.6.0-rc3-00013-g34f66c4c4d55 #1\n| Hardware name: linux,dummy-virt (DT)\n| pstate: 400000c9 (nZcv daIF -PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--)\n| pc : __pi_strcmp+0x1c/0x150\n| lr : populate_properties+0xe4/0x254\n| sp : ffffd014173d3ad0\n| x29: ffffd014173d3af0 x28: fffffbfffddffcb8 x27: 0000000000000000\n| x26: 0000000000000058 x25: fffffbfffddfe054 x24: 0000000000000008\n| x23: fffffbfffddfe000 x22: fffffbfffddfe000 x21: fffffbfffddfe044\n| x20: ffffd014173d3b70 x19: 0000000000000001 x18: 0000000000000005\n| x17: 0000000000000010 x16: 0000000000000000 x15: 00000000413e7000\n| x14: 0000000000000000 x13: 0000000000001bcc x12: 0000000000000000\n| x11: 00000000d00dfeed x10: ffffd414193f2cd0 x9 : 0000000000000000\n| x8 : 0101010101010101 x7 : ffffffffffffffc0 x6 : 0000000000000000\n| x5 : 0000000000000000 x4 : 0101010101010101 x3 : 000000000000002a\n| x2 : 0000000000000001 x1 : ffffd014171f2988 x0 : fffffbfffddffcb8\n| Kernel panic - not syncing: Unhandled exception\n| CPU: 0 PID: 0 Comm: swapper Not tainted 6.6.0-rc3-00013-g34f66c4c4d55 #1\n| Hardware name: linux,dummy-virt (DT)\n| Call trace:\n|  dump_backtrace+0xec/0x108\n|  show_stack+0x18/0x2c\n|  dump_stack_lvl+0x50/0x68\n|  dump_stack+0x18/0x24\n|  panic+0x13c/0x340\n|  el1t_64_irq_handler+0x0/0x1c\n|  el1_abort+0x0/0x5c\n|  el1h_64_sync+0x64/0x68\n|  __pi_strcmp+0x1c/0x150\n|  unflatten_dt_nodes+0x1e8/0x2d8\n|  __unflatten_device_tree+0x5c/0x15c\n|  unflatten_device_tree+0x38/0x50\n|  setup_arch+0x164/0x1e0\n|  start_kernel+0x64/0x38c\n|  __primary_switched+0xbc/0xc4\n\nRestrict CONFIG_CPU_BIG_ENDIAN to a known good assembler, which is\neither GNU as or LLVM's IAS 15.0.0 and newer, which contains the linked\ncommit.",

When constructing the deployment instance of the app, env was found from the database and directly inserted into the template, resulting in controllability here. Sensitive information in the secret and configmap can be read through the k8s envFrom field. In a privatization environment, when `namespaceConf. fixed` is marked, it may lead to the leakage of sensitive information in the system.

    "漏洞描述": "Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the fulfillment of data privacy requests in a runtime environment, and the enforcement of privacy regulations in code. The Fides webserver API allows custom integrations to be uploaded as a ZIP file. This ZIP file must contain YAML files, but Fides can be configured to also accept the inclusion of custom Python code in it. The custom code is executed in a restricted, sandboxed environment, but the sandbox can be bypassed to execute any arbitrary code. The vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary code on the target system within the context of the webserver python process owner on the webserver container, which by default is `root`, and leverage that access to attack underlying infrastructure and integrated systems. This vulnerability affects Fides versions `2.11.0` through `2.19.0`. Exploitation is limited to API clients with the `CONNECTOR_TEMPLATE_REGISTER` authorization scope. In the Fides Admin UI this scope is restricted to highly privileged users, specifically root users and users with the owner role.  Exploitation is only possible if the security configuration parameter `allow_custom_connector_functions` is enabled by the user deploying the Fides webserver container, either in `fides.toml` or by setting the env var `FIDES__SECURITY__ALLOW_CUSTOM_CONNECTOR_FUNCTIONS=True`. By default this configuration parameter is disabled. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.19.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that `allow_custom_connector_functions` in `fides.toml` and the `FIDES__SECURITY__ALLOW_CUSTOM_CONNECTOR_FUNCTIONS` are both either unset or explicit set to `False`.",

An LTI tool submits scores to the edX platform for line items. The code that uploads that score to the LMS grade tables determines which XBlock to upload the grades for by reading the resource_link_id field of the associated line item. The LTI tool may submit any value for the resource_link_id field, allowing a malicious LTI tool to submit scores for any LTI XBlock on the platform.

    "漏洞描述": "In BIND 9.5.0 -> 9.11.29, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.13, and versions BIND 9.11.3-S1 -> 9.11.29-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.13-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition, as well as release versions 9.17.0 -> 9.17.1 of the BIND 9.17 development branch, BIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected version and are configured to use GSS-TSIG features. In a configuration which uses BIND's default settings the vulnerable code path is not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credential configuration options. Although the default configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers. For servers that meet these conditions, the ISC SPNEGO implementation is vulnerable to various attacks, depending on the CPU architecture for which BIND was built: For named binaries compiled for 64-bit platforms, this flaw can be used to trigger a buffer over-read, leading to a server crash. For named binaries compiled for 32-bit platforms, this flaw can be used to trigger a server crash due to a buffer overflow and possibly also to achieve remote code execution. We have determined that standard SPNEGO implementations are available in the MIT and Heimdal Kerberos libraries, which support a broad range of operating systems, rendering the ISC implementation unnecessary and obsolete. Therefore, to reduce the attack surface for BIND users, we will be removing the ISC SPNEGO implementation in the April releases of BIND 9.11 and 9.16 (it had already been dropped from BIND 9.17). We would not normally remove something from a stable ESV (Extended Support Version) of BIND, but since system libraries can replace the ISC SPNEGO implementation, we have made an exception in this case for reasons of stability and security.",

In a configuration which uses BIND's default settings the vulnerable code path is not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting valid values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credentialconfiguration options. Although the default configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers. The most likely outcome of a successful exploitation of the vulnerability is a crash of the named process. However, remote code execution, while unproven, is theoretically possible. Affects: BIND 9.5.0 -> 9.11.27, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.11, and versions BIND 9.11.3-S1 -> 9.11.27-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.11-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition.

    "漏洞描述": "A vulnerability in the implementation of the inter-VM channel of Cisco IOS Software for Cisco 809 and 829 Industrial Integrated Services Routers (Industrial ISRs) and Cisco 1000 Series Connected Grid Routers (CGR1000) could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the Virtual Device Server (VDS) of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of signaling packets that are destined to VDS. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands in the context of the Linux shell of VDS with the privileges of the root user. Because the device is designed on a hypervisor architecture, exploitation of a vulnerability that affects the inter-VM channel may lead to a complete system compromise.
