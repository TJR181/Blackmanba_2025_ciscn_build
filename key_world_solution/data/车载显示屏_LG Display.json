In particular, this concerns custom display code, the script of computed properties and queries in database list properties. Note that warnings before editing documents with dangerous properties have only been introduced in XWiki 15.9, before that version, this was a known issue and the advice was simply to be careful. This has been patched in XWiki 16.10.2, 16.4.7 and 15.10.16 by adding an analysis for the respective XClass properties.",

    "CVE编号": "CVE-2025-49012",
    "漏洞描述": "Himmelblau is an interoperability suite for Microsoft Azure Entra ID and Intune. Himmelblau versions 0.9.0 through 0.9.14 and 1.00-alpha are vulnerable to a privilege escalation issue when Entra ID group-based access restrictions are configured using group display names instead of object IDs. Starting in version 0.9.0, Himmelblau introduced support for specifying group names in the `pam_allow_groups` configuration option. However, Microsoft Entra ID permits the creation of multiple groups with the same `displayName` via the Microsoft Graph API—even by non-admin users, depending on tenant settings. As a result, a user could create a personal group with the same name as a legitimate access group (e.g., `\"Allow-Linux-Login\"`), add themselves to it, and be granted authentication or `sudo` rights by Himmelblau. Because affected Himmelblau versions compare group names by either `displayName` or by the immutable `objectId`, this allows bypassing access control mechanisms intended to restrict login to members of official, centrally-managed groups. This issue is fixed in Himmelblau version **0.9.15** and later. In these versions, group name matching in `pam_allow_groups` has been deprecated and removed, and only group `objectId`s (GUIDs) may be specified for secure group-based filtering. To mitigate the issue without upgrading, replace all entries in `pam_allow_groups` with the objectId of the target Entra ID group(s) and/or audit your tenant for groups with duplicate display names using the Microsoft Graph API.",

It also allows to show the contents of registers using the `:registers` or `:display` ex command. When redirecting the output of `:display` to a register, Vim will free the register content before storing the new content in the register. Now when redirecting the `:display` command to a register that is being displayed, Vim will free the content while shortly afterwards trying to access it, which leads to a use-after-free. Vim pre 9.1.1115 checks in the ex_display() function, that it does not try to redirect to a register while displaying this register at the same time. However this check is not complete, and so Vim does not check the `+` and `*` registers (which typically donate the X11/clipboard registers, and when a clipboard connection is not possible will fall back to use register 0 instead. In Patch 9.1.1115 Vim will therefore skip outputting to register zero when trying to redirect to the clipboard registers `*` or `+`. Users are advised to upgrade.

    "漏洞描述": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvlan: enforce underlying device type\n\nCurrently, VLAN devices can be created on top of non-ethernet devices.\n\nBesides the fact that it doesn't make much sense, this also causes a\nbug which leaks the address of a kernel function to usermode.\n\nWhen creating a VLAN device, we initialize GARP (garp_init_applicant)\nand MRP (mrp_init_applicant) for the underlying device.\n\nAs part of the initialization process, we add the multicast address of\neach applicant to the underlying device, by calling dev_mc_add.\n\n__dev_mc_add uses dev->addr_len to determine the length of the new\nmulticast address.\n\nThis causes an out-of-bounds read if dev->addr_len is greater than 6,\nsince the multicast addresses provided by GARP and MRP are only 6\nbytes long.\n\nThis behaviour can be reproduced using the following commands:\n\nip tunnel add gretest mode ip6gre local ::1 remote ::2 dev lo\nip l set up dev gretest\nip link add link gretest name vlantest type vlan id 100\n\nThen, the following command will display the address of garp_pdu_rcv:\n\nip maddr show | grep 01:80:c2:00:00:21\n\nFix the bug by enforcing the type of the underlying device during VLAN\ndevice initialization.",

    "漏洞描述": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/v3d: Assign job pointer to NULL before signaling the fence\n\nIn commit e4b5ccd392b9 (\"drm/v3d: Ensure job pointer is set to NULL\nafter job completion\"), we introduced a change to assign the job pointer\nto NULL after completing a job, indicating job completion.\n\nHowever, this approach created a race condition between the DRM\nscheduler workqueue and the IRQ execution thread. As soon as the fence is\nsignaled in the IRQ execution thread, a new job starts to be executed.\nThis results in a race condition where the IRQ execution thread sets the\njob pointer to NULL simultaneously as the `run_job()` function assigns\na new job to the pointer.\n\nThis race condition can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the IRQ\nexecution thread sets the job pointer to NULL after `run_job()` assigns\nit to the new job. When the new job completes and the GPU emits an\ninterrupt, `v3d_irq()` is triggered, potentially causing a crash.\n\n[  466.310099] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000000000c0\n[  466.318928] Mem abort info:\n[  466.321723]   ESR = 0x0000000096000005\n[  466.325479]   EC = 0x25: DABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits\n[  466.330807]   SET = 0, FnV = 0\n[  466.333864]   EA = 0, S1PTW = 0\n[  466.337010]   FSC = 0x05: level 1 translation fault\n[  466.341900] Data abort info:\n[  466.344783]   ISV = 0, ISS = 0x00000005, ISS2 = 0x00000000\n[  466.350285]   CM = 0, WnR = 0, TnD = 0, TagAccess = 0\n[  466.355350]   GCS = 0, Overlay = 0, DirtyBit = 0, Xs = 0\n[  466.360677] user pgtable: 4k pages, 39-bit VAs, pgdp=0000000089772000\n[  466.367140] [00000000000000c0] pgd=0000000000000000, p4d=0000000000000000, pud=0000000000000000\n[  466.375875] Internal error: Oops: 0000000096000005 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\n[  466.382163] Modules linked in: rfcomm snd_seq_dummy snd_hrtimer snd_seq snd_seq_device algif_hash algif_skcipher af_alg bnep binfmt_misc vc4 snd_soc_hdmi_codec drm_display_helper cec brcmfmac_wcc spidev rpivid_hevc(C) drm_client_lib brcmfmac hci_uart drm_dma_helper pisp_be btbcm brcmutil snd_soc_core aes_ce_blk v4l2_mem2mem bluetooth aes_ce_cipher snd_compress videobuf2_dma_contig ghash_ce cfg80211 gf128mul snd_pcm_dmaengine videobuf2_memops ecdh_generic sha2_ce ecc videobuf2_v4l2 snd_pcm v3d sha256_arm64 rfkill videodev snd_timer sha1_ce libaes gpu_sched snd videobuf2_common sha1_generic drm_shmem_helper mc rp1_pio drm_kms_helper raspberrypi_hwmon spi_bcm2835 gpio_keys i2c_brcmstb rp1 raspberrypi_gpiomem rp1_mailbox rp1_adc nvmem_rmem uio_pdrv_genirq uio i2c_dev drm ledtrig_pattern drm_panel_orientation_quirks backlight fuse dm_mod ip_tables x_tables ipv6\n[  466.458429] CPU: 0 UID: 1000 PID: 2008 Comm: chromium Tainted: G         C         6.13.0-v8+ #18\n[  466.467336] Tainted: [C]=CRAP\n[  466.470306] Hardware name: Raspberry Pi 5 Model B Rev 1.0 (DT)\n[  466.476157] pstate: 404000c9 (nZcv daIF +PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--)\n[  466.483143] pc : v3d_irq+0x118/0x2e0 [v3d]\n[  466.487258] lr : __handle_irq_event_percpu+0x60/0x228\n[  466.492327] sp : ffffffc080003ea0\n[  466.495646] x29: ffffffc080003ea0 x28: ffffff80c0c94200 x27: 0000000000000000\n[  466.502807] x26: ffffffd08dd81d7b x25: ffffff80c0c94200 x24: ffffff8003bdc200\n[  466.509969] x23: 0000000000000001 x22: 00000000000000a7 x21: 0000000000000000\n[  466.517130] x20: ffffff8041bb0000 x19: 0000000000000001 x18: 0000000000000000\n[  466.524291] x17: ffffffafadfb0000 x16: ffffffc080000000 x15: 0000000000000000\n[  466.531452] x14: 0000000000000000 x13: 0000000000000000 x12: 0000000000000000\n[  466.538613] x11: 0000000000000000 x10: 0000000000000000 x9 : ffffffd08c527eb0\n[  466.545777] x8 : 0000000000000000 x7 : 0000000000000000 x6 : 0000000000000000\n[  466.552941] x5 : ffffffd08c4100d0 x4 : ffffffafadfb0000 x3 : ffffffc080003f70\n[  466.560102] x2 : ffffffc0829e8058 x1 : 0000000000000001 x0 : 0000000000000000\n[  466.567263] Call trace:\n[  466.569711]  v3d_irq+0x118/0x2e0 [v3d] (P)\n[  466.\n---truncated---",

    "漏洞描述": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI: imx6: Fix suspend/resume support on i.MX6QDL\n\nThe suspend/resume functionality is currently broken on the i.MX6QDL\nplatform, as documented in the NXP errata (ERR005723):\n\n  https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/errata/IMX6DQCE.pdf\n\nThis patch addresses the issue by sharing most of the suspend/resume\nsequences used by other i.MX devices, while avoiding modifications to\ncritical registers that disrupt the PCIe functionality. It targets the\nsame problem as the following downstream commit:\n\n  https://github.com/nxp-imx/linux-imx/commit/4e92355e1f79d225ea842511fcfd42b343b32995\n\nUnlike the downstream commit, this patch also resets the connected PCIe\ndevice if possible. Without this reset, certain drivers, such as ath10k\nor iwlwifi, will crash on resume. The device reset is also done by the\ndriver on other i.MX platforms, making this patch consistent with\nexisting practices.\n\nUpon resuming, the kernel will hang and display an error. Here's an\nexample of the error encountered with the ath10k driver:\n\n  ath10k_pci 0000:01:00.0: Unable to change power state from D3hot to D0, device inaccessible\n  Unhandled fault: imprecise external abort (0x1406) at 0x0106f944\n\nWithout this patch, suspend/resume will fail on i.MX6QDL devices if a\nPCIe device is connected.\n\n[kwilczynski: commit log, added tag for stable releases]",

Although all perfmons are destroyed in `v3d_perfmon_close_file()`,\nthe active performance monitor's pointer (`v3d->active_perfmon`) is still\nretained.\n\nIf `kmscube` is run again, the driver will attempt to stop the active\nperformance monitor using the stale pointer in `v3d->active_perfmon`.\nHowever, this pointer is no longer valid because the previous process has\nalready terminated, and all performance monitors associated with it have\nbeen destroyed and freed.\n\nTo fix this, when the active performance monitor belongs to a given\nprocess, explicitly stop it before destroying and freeing it.",

    "漏洞描述": "Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. Prior to Sep 27, 2024, if a user generated a terminal command via Cursor's Terminal Cmd-K/Ctrl-K feature and if the user explicitly imported a malicious web page into the Terminal Cmd-K prompt, an attacker with control over the referenced web page could have a significant chance of influencing a language model to output arbitrary commands for execution in the user's terminal. This scenario would require the user explicitly opt-in to including the contents of a compromised webpage, and it would require that the attacker display prompt injection text in the the contents of the compromised webpage.\n\nA server-side patch to not stream back newlines or control characters was released on September 27, 2024, within two hours of the issue being reported. Additionally, Cursor 0.42 includes client-side mitigations to prevent any newline or control character from being streamed into the terminal directly. It also contains a new setting, `\"cursor.terminal.usePreviewBox\"`, which, if set to true, streams the response into a preview box whose contents then have to be manually accepted before being inserted into the terminal. This setting is useful if you're working in a shell environment where commands can be executed without pressing enter or any control character. The patch has been applied server-side, so no additional action is needed, even on older versions of Cursor. Separately, Cursor's maintainers also recommend, as best practice, to only include trusted pieces of context in prompts.",

    "漏洞描述": "Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This vulnerability involves **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** on any Gradio server that allows file uploads. Authenticated users can upload files such as HTML, JavaScript, or SVG files containing malicious scripts. When other users download or view these files, the scripts will execute in their browser, allowing attackers to perform unauthorized actions or steal sensitive information from their sessions. This impacts any Gradio server that allows file uploads, particularly those using components that process or display user-uploaded files. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>=5` to address this issue. As a workaround, users can restrict the types of files that can be uploaded to the Gradio server by limiting uploads to non-executable file types such as images or text. Additionally, developers can implement server-side validation to sanitize uploaded files, ensuring that HTML, JavaScript, and SVG files are properly handled or rejected before being stored or displayed to users.",

Previously,\nset_output_gamma was being checked for nullity at line 386, but then it\nwas being dereferenced without any nullity check at line 401. This\ncould potentially lead to a null pointer dereference error if\nset_output_gamma is indeed null.\n\nTo fix this, we now ensure that set_output_gamma is not null before\ndereferencing it. We do this by adding a nullity check for\nset_output_gamma before the call to set_output_gamma at line 401.

By design, certain APIs, such as the login screen, banner display, and device registration, do not require authentication. However, it was discovered that for Directors directly connected to the Internet, one of these APIs can be exploited by injecting invalid arguments into a GET request, potentially exposing the authentication tokens of other currently logged-in users. These tokens can then be used to invoke additional APIs on port 9183. This exploit does not disclose any username or password information. \r\n\r\nCurrently, there are no workarounds in Versa Director. However, if there is Web Application Firewall (WAF) or API Gateway fronting the Versa Director, it can be used to block access to the URLs of vulnerable API.  /vnms/devicereg/device/* (on ports 9182 & 9183) and /versa/vnms/devicereg/device/* (on port 443). Versa recommends that Directors be upgraded to one of the remediated software versions.

    "漏洞描述": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Add null checks for 'stream' and 'plane' before dereferencing\n\nThis commit adds null checks for the 'stream' and 'plane' variables in\nthe dcn30_apply_idle_power_optimizations function. These variables were\npreviously assumed to be null at line 922, but they were used later in\nthe code without checking if they were null. This could potentially lead\nto a null pointer dereference, which would cause a crash.\n\nThe null checks ensure that 'stream' and 'plane' are not null before\nthey are used, preventing potential crashes.\n\nFixes the below static smatch checker:\ndrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/hwss/dcn30/dcn30_hwseq.c:938 dcn30_apply_idle_power_optimizations() error: we previously assumed 'stream' could be null (see line 922)\ndrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/hwss/dcn30/dcn30_hwseq.c:940 dcn30_apply_idle_power_optimizations() error: we previously assumed 'plane' could be null (see line 922)",

    "漏洞描述": "GoCD is a continuous delivery server. GoCD versions from 19.4.0 to 23.5.0 (inclusive) are potentially vulnerable to a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability on the loading page displayed while GoCD is starting, via abuse of a `redirect_to` query parameter with inadequate validation.\n\nAttackers could theoretically abuse the query parameter to steal session tokens or other values from the user's browser. In practice exploiting this to perform privileged actions is likely rather difficult to exploit because the target user would need to be triggered to open an attacker-crafted link in the period where the server is starting up (but not completely started), requiring chaining with a separate denial-of-service vulnerability. Additionally, GoCD server restarts invalidate earlier session tokens (i.e GoCD does not support persistent sessions), so a stolen session token would be unusable once the server has completed restart, and executed XSS would be done within a logged-out context.\n\nThe issue is fixed in GoCD 24.1.0. As a workaround, it is technically possible in earlier GoCD versions to override the loading page with an earlier version which is not vulnerable, by starting GoCD with the Java system property override as either `-Dloading.page.resource.path=/loading_pages/default.loading.page.html` (simpler early version of loading page without GoCD introduction) or `-Dloading.page.resource.path=/does_not_exist.html` (to display a simple message with no interactivity).",

    "漏洞描述": "Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime with secure defaults. Starting in version 1.32.1 and prior to version 1.41.0 of the deno library, maliciously crafted permission request can show the spoofed permission prompt by inserting a broken ANSI escape sequence into the request contents. Deno is stripping any ANSI escape sequences from the permission prompt, but permissions given to the program are based on the contents that contain the ANSI escape sequences. Any Deno program can spoof the content of the interactive permission prompt by inserting a broken ANSI code, which allows a malicious Deno program to display the wrong file path or program name to the user. Version 1.41.0 of the deno library contains a patch for the issue.",

    "漏洞描述": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsoc: qcom: pmic_glink_altmode: fix drm bridge use-after-free\n\nA recent DRM series purporting to simplify support for \"transparent\nbridges\" and handling of probe deferrals ironically exposed a\nuse-after-free issue on pmic_glink_altmode probe deferral.\n\nThis has manifested itself as the display subsystem occasionally failing\nto initialise and NULL-pointer dereferences during boot of machines like\nthe Lenovo ThinkPad X13s.\n\nSpecifically, the dp-hpd bridge is currently registered before all\nresources have been acquired which means that it can also be\nderegistered on probe deferrals.\n\nIn the meantime there is a race window where the new aux bridge driver\n(or PHY driver previously) may have looked up the dp-hpd bridge and\nstored a (non-reference-counted) pointer to the bridge which is about to\nbe deallocated.\n\nWhen the display controller is later initialised, this triggers a\nuse-after-free when attaching the bridges:\n\n\tdp -> aux -> dp-hpd (freed)\n\nwhich may, for example, result in the freed bridge failing to attach:\n\n\t[drm:drm_bridge_attach [drm]] *ERROR* failed to attach bridge /soc@0/phy@88eb000 to encoder TMDS-31: -16\n\nor a NULL-pointer dereference:\n\n\tUnable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000\n\t...\n\tCall trace:\n\t  drm_bridge_attach+0x70/0x1a8 [drm]\n\t  drm_aux_bridge_attach+0x24/0x38 [aux_bridge]\n\t  drm_bridge_attach+0x80/0x1a8 [drm]\n\t  dp_bridge_init+0xa8/0x15c [msm]\n\t  msm_dp_modeset_init+0x28/0xc4 [msm]\n\nThe DRM bridge implementation is clearly fragile and implicitly built on\nthe assumption that bridges may never go away. In this case, the fix is\nto move the bridge registration in the pmic_glink_altmode driver to\nafter all resources have been looked up.\n\nIncidentally, with the new dp-hpd bridge implementation, which registers\nchild devices, this is also a requirement due to a long-standing issue\nin driver core that can otherwise lead to a probe deferral loop (see\ncommit fbc35b45f9f6 (\"Add documentation on meaning of -EPROBE_DEFER\")).\n\n[DB: slightly fixed commit message by adding the word 'commit']",

Using a software state to track whether or not we need to start\n   the process to exit idle or notify idle.\n\nIt's possible for the hardware to have exited an idle state without\ndriver knowledge, but entering one is always restricted to a driver\nallow - which makes the SW state vs HW state mismatch issue purely one\nof optimization, which should seldomly be hit, if at all.\n\n2. Refactor any instances of exit/notify idle to use a single wrapper\n   that maintains this SW state.\n\nThis works simialr to dc_allow_idle_optimizations, but works at the\nDMCUB level and makes sure the state is marked prior to any notify/exit\nidle so we don't enter an infinite loop.\n\n3. Make sure we exit out of idle prior to sending any commands or\n   waiting for DMCUB idle.\n\nThis patch takes care of 1/2. A future patch will take care of wrapping\nDMCUB command submission with calls to this new interface.",

    "漏洞描述": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommu: Don't reserve 0-length IOVA region\n\nWhen the bootloader/firmware doesn't setup the framebuffers, their\naddress and size are 0 in \"iommu-addresses\" property. If IOVA region is\nreserved with 0 length, then it ends up corrupting the IOVA rbtree with\nan entry which has pfn_hi < pfn_lo.\nIf we intend to use display driver in kernel without framebuffer then\nit's causing the display IOMMU mappings to fail as entire valid IOVA\nspace is reserved when address and length are passed as 0.\nAn ideal solution would be firmware removing the \"iommu-addresses\"\nproperty and corresponding \"memory-region\" if display is not present.\nBut the kernel should be able to handle this by checking for size of\nIOVA region and skipping the IOVA reservation if size is 0. Also, add\na warning if firmware is requesting 0-length IOVA region reservation.",

    "漏洞描述": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. The rendered diff in XWiki embeds images to be able to compare the contents and not display a difference for an actually unchanged image. For this, XWiki requests all embedded images on the server side. These requests are also sent for images from other domains and include all cookies that were sent in the original request to ensure that images with restricted view right can be compared. Starting in version 11.10.1 and prior to versions 14.10.15, 15.5.1, and 15.6, this allows an attacker to steal login and session cookies that allow impersonating the current user who views the diff. The attack can be triggered with an image that references the rendered diff, thus making it easy to trigger. Apart from stealing login cookies, this also allows server-side request forgery (the result of any successful request is returned in the image's source) and viewing protected content as once a resource is cached, it is returned for all users. As only successful requests are cached, the cache will be filled by the first user who is allowed to access the resource. This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.15, 15.5.1 and 15.6. The rendered diff now only downloads images from trusted domains. Further, cookies are only sent when the image's domain is the same the requested domain. The cache has been changed to be specific for each user. As a workaround, the image embedding feature can be disabled by deleting `xwiki-platform-diff-xml-<version>.jar` in `WEB-INF/lib/`.",

    "漏洞描述": "The vulnerability is that the Messaging (\"com.android.mms\") app patched by LG forwards attacker-controlled intents back to the attacker in the exported \"com.android.mms.ui.QClipIntentReceiverActivity\" activity. The attacker can abuse this functionality by launching this activity and then sending a broadcast with the \"com.lge.message.action.QCLIP\" action. The attacker can send, e.g., their own data/clipdata and set Intent.FLAG_GRANT_* flags. After the attacker received that intent in the \"onActivityResult()\" method, they would have access to arbitrary content providers that have the `android:grantUriPermissions=\"true\"` flag set.",

The default behaviour of `hyper-bump-it` is to display the planned changes and prompt the user for confirmation before editing any files. However, the configuration file provides a field that can be used cause files to be edited without displaying the prompt. This issue has been fixed in release version 0.5.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users that are unable to update from vulnerable versions, executing `hyper-bump-it` with the `--interactive` command line argument will ensure that all planned changes are displayed and prompt the user for confirmation before editing any files, even if the configuration file contains `show_confirm_prompt=true`.\n",

This issue is present since version 4.3M2 when AppWithinMinutes Application added support for the Content field, allowing any wiki page (including the user profile page) to use its content as an AWM Content field, which has a custom displayer that executes the content with the rights of the ``AppWithinMinutes.Content`` author, rather than the rights of the content author. The vulnerability has been fixed in XWiki 14.10.5 and 15.1RC1. The fix is in the content of the AppWithinMinutes.Content page that defines the custom displayer.

In the context of XWiki, this allows an attacker without script right to either create forms that can be used for phishing attacks or also in the context of a sheet, the attacker could add an input like `{{html}}<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"content\" value=\"{{groovy}}println(&quot;Hello from Groovy!&quot;)\" />{{/html}}` that would allow remote code execution when it is submitted by an admin (the sheet is rendered as part of the edit form). The attacker would need to ensure that the edit form looks plausible, though, which can be non-trivial as without script right the attacker cannot display the regular content of the document. This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.6 and 15.2RC1 by removing the central form-related tags from the list of allowed tags. Users are advised to upgrade. As a workaround an admin can manually disallow the tags by adding `form, input, select, textarea, button` to the configuration option `xml.htmlElementSanitizer.forbidTags` in the `xwiki.properties` configuration file.",

The security flaw occurs because the functions in src/InitExt.c in libX11 do not check that the values provided for the Request, Event, or Error IDs are within the bounds of the arrays that those functions write to, using those IDs as array indexes. They trust that they were called with values provided by an Xserver adhering to the bounds specified in the X11 protocol, as all X servers provided by X.Org do. As the protocol only specifies a single byte for these values, an out-of-bounds value provided by a malicious server (or a malicious proxy-in-the-middle) can only overwrite other portions of the Display structure and not write outside the bounds of the Display structure itself, possibly causing the client to crash with this memory corruption.",

OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate\nan ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL\ntype ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the\nsub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by\nperiods.\n\nWhen one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large\n(these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds\nof KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long\ntime.  The time complexity is O(n^2) with 'n' being the size of the\nsub-identifiers in bytes (*).\n\nWith OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /\nidentifiers in string form was introduced.  This includes using OBJECT\nIDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching\nalgorithms.\n\nSuch OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structure\nAlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specify\nwhat cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or\ndecrypt, or digest passed data.\n\nApplications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are\naffected, with any version of OpenSSL.  If the use is for the mere purpose\nof display, the severity is considered low.\n\nIn OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME,\nCMS, CMP/CRMF or TS.  It also impacts anything that processes X.509\ncertificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.\n\nThe impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a\n100KiB limit on the peer's certificate chain.  Additionally, this only\nimpacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client\nauthentication.\n\nIn OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,\nsuch as X.509 certificates.  This is assumed to not happen in such a way\nthat it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considered\nnot affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern,\nand the severity is therefore considered low.",

    "漏洞描述": "Jetty is a java based web server and servlet engine. Nonstandard cookie parsing in Jetty may allow an attacker to smuggle cookies within other cookies, or otherwise perform unintended behavior by tampering with the cookie parsing mechanism. If Jetty sees a cookie VALUE that starts with `\"` (double quote), it will continue to read the cookie string until it sees a closing quote -- even if a semicolon is encountered. So, a cookie header such as: `DISPLAY_LANGUAGE=\"b; JSESSIONID=1337; c=d\"` will be parsed as one cookie, with the name DISPLAY_LANGUAGE and a value of b; JSESSIONID=1337; c=d instead of 3 separate cookies. This has security implications because if, say, JSESSIONID is an HttpOnly cookie, and the DISPLAY_LANGUAGE cookie value is rendered on the page, an attacker can smuggle the JSESSIONID cookie into the DISPLAY_LANGUAGE cookie and thereby exfiltrate it. This is significant when an intermediary is enacting some policy based on cookies, so a smuggled cookie can bypass that policy yet still be seen by the Jetty server or its logging system. This issue has been addressed in versions 9.4.51, 10.0.14, 11.0.14, and 12.0.0.beta0 and users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",

    "漏洞描述": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Fix double free during GPU reset on DC streams\n\n[Why]\nThe issue only occurs during the GPU reset code path.\n\nWe first backup the current state prior to commiting 0 streams\ninternally from DM to DC. This state backup contains valid link\nencoder assignments.\n\nDC will clear the link encoder assignments as part of current state\n(but not the backup, since it was a copied before the commit) and\nfree the extra stream reference it held.\n\nDC requires that the link encoder assignments remain cleared/invalid\nprior to commiting. Since the backup still has valid assignments we\ncall the interface post reset to clear them. This routine also\nreleases the extra reference that the link encoder interface held -\nresulting in a double free (and eventually a NULL pointer dereference).\n\n[How]\nWe'll have to do a full DC commit anyway after GPU reset because\nthe stream count previously went to 0.\n\nWe don't need to retain the assignment that we had backed up, so\njust copy off of the now clean current state assignment after the\nreset has occcurred with the new link_enc_cfg_copy() interface.",

    "漏洞描述": "Git is distributed revision control system. `git log` can display commits in an arbitrary format using its `--format` specifiers. This functionality is also exposed to `git archive` via the `export-subst` gitattribute. When processing the padding operators, there is a integer overflow in `pretty.c::format_and_pad_commit()` where a `size_t` is stored improperly as an `int`, and then added as an offset to a `memcpy()`. This overflow can be triggered directly by a user running a command which invokes the commit formatting machinery (e.g., `git log --format=...`). It may also be triggered indirectly through git archive via the export-subst mechanism, which expands format specifiers inside of files within the repository during a git archive. This integer overflow can result in arbitrary heap writes, which may result in arbitrary code execution. The problem has been patched in the versions published on 2023-01-17, going back to v2.30.7. Users are advised to upgrade. Users who are unable to upgrade should disable `git archive` in untrusted repositories. If you expose git archive via `git daemon`, disable it by running `git config --global daemon.uploadArch false`.",

To do this, Javascript's [`eval`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval) function is used to execute strings that begin with \"function\" as Javascript. This unfortunately could allow arbitrary code to be executed if it exists as a value within the JSON structure being displayed. Given that this component may often be used to display data from arbitrary, untrusted sources, this is extremely dangerous. One important note is that users who have defined a custom [`onSubmitValueParser`](https://github.com/oxyno-zeta/react-editable-json-tree/tree/09a0ca97835b0834ad054563e2fddc6f22bc5d8c#onsubmitvalueparser) callback prop on the [`JsonTree`](https://github.com/oxyno-zeta/react-editable-json-tree/blob/09a0ca97835b0834ad054563e2fddc6f22bc5d8c/src/JsonTree.js) component should be ***unaffected***. This vulnerability exists in the default `onSubmitValueParser` prop which calls [`parse`](https://github.com/oxyno-zeta/react-editable-json-tree/blob/master/src/utils/parse.js#L30). Prop is added to `JsonTree` called `allowFunctionEvaluation`. This prop will be set to `true` in v2.2.2, which allows upgrade without losing backwards-compatibility. In v2.2.2, we switched from using `eval` to using [`Function`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function) to construct anonymous functions. This is better than `eval` for the following reasons: - Arbitrary code should not be able to execute immediately, since the `Function` constructor explicitly *only creates* anonymous functions - Functions are created without local closures, so they only have access to the global scope If you use: - **Version `<2.2.2`**, you must upgrade as soon as possible. - **Version `^2.2.2`**, you must explicitly set `JsonTree`'s `allowFunctionEvaluation` prop to `false` to fully mitigate this vulnerability. - **Version `>=3.0.0`**, `allowFunctionEvaluation` is already set to `false` by default, so no further steps are necessary.",

    "漏洞描述": "Tabit - giftcard stealth. Several APIs on the web system display, without authorization, sensitive information such as health statements, previous bills in a specific restaurant, alcohol consumption and smoking habits. Each of the described APIs, has in its URL one or more MongoDB ID which is not so simple to enumerate. However, they each receive a 'tiny URL' in tabits domain, in the form of https://tbit.be/{suffix} with suffix being a 5 character long string containing numbers, lower and upper case letters. It is not so simple to enumerate them all, but really easy to find some that work and lead to a personal endpoint. Furthermore, the redirect URL disclosed the MongoDB IDs discussed above, and we could use them to query other endpoints disclosing more personal information.",

    "漏洞描述": "Tabit - sensitive information disclosure. Several APIs on the web system display, without authorization, sensitive information such as health statements, previous bills in a specific restaurant, alcohol consumption and smoking habits. Each of the described API’s, has in its URL one or more MongoDB ID which is not so simple to enumerate. However, they each receive a ‘tiny URL’ in Tabit’s domain, in the form of https://tbit.be/{suffix} with suffix being a 5 characters long string containing numbers, lower- and upper-case letters. It is not so simple to enumerate them all, but really easy to find some that work and lead to a personal endpoint. This is both an example of OWASP: API4 - rate limiting and OWASP: API1 - Broken object level authorization. Furthermore, the redirect URL disclosed the MongoDB IDs discussed above, and we could use them to query other endpoints disclosing more personal information. For example: The URL https://tabitisrael.co.il/online-reservations/health-statement?orgId={org_id}&healthStatementId={health_statement_id} is used to invite friends to fill a health statement before attending the restaurant. We can use the health_statement_id to access the https://tgm-api.tabit.cloud/health-statement/{health_statement_id} API which disclose medical information as well as id number.",

In combination with certain other HTML elements and attributes in the email, it was possible to execute JavaScript code included in the message in the context of the message compose document. The JavaScript code was able to perform actions including, but probably not limited to, read and modify the contents of the message compose document, including the quoted original message, which could potentially contain the decrypted plaintext of encrypted data in the crafted email. The contents could then be transmitted to the network, either to the URL specified in the META refresh tag, or to a different URL, as the JavaScript code could modify the URL specified in the document. This bug doesn't affect users who have changed the default Message Body display setting to 'simple html' or 'plain text'. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.2.1 and Thunderbird < 91.13.1.",

    "漏洞描述": "An issue was discovered in the Bidirectional Algorithm in the Unicode Specification through 14.0. It permits the visual reordering of characters via control sequences, which can be used to craft source code that renders different logic than the logical ordering of tokens ingested by compilers and interpreters. Adversaries can leverage this to encode source code for compilers accepting Unicode such that targeted vulnerabilities are introduced invisibly to human reviewers. NOTE: the Unicode Consortium offers the following alternative approach to presenting this concern. An issue is noted in the nature of international text that can affect applications that implement support for The Unicode Standard and the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm (all versions). Due to text display behavior when text includes left-to-right and right-to-left characters, the visual order of tokens may be different from their logical order. Additionally, control characters needed to fully support the requirements of bidirectional text can further obfuscate the logical order of tokens. Unless mitigated, an adversary could craft source code such that the ordering of tokens perceived by human reviewers does not match what will be processed by a compiler/interpreter/etc. The Unicode Consortium has documented this class of vulnerability in its document, Unicode Technical Report #36, Unicode Security Considerations. The Unicode Consortium also provides guidance on mitigations for this class of issues in Unicode Technical Standard #39, Unicode Security Mechanisms, and in Unicode Standard Annex #31, Unicode Identifier and Pattern Syntax. Also, the BIDI specification allows applications to tailor the implementation in ways that can mitigate misleading visual reordering in program text; see HL4 in Unicode Standard Annex #9, Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm.",

XSS is in most cases prevented by strict CSP in all modern browsers. The only exception is when Adminer is using a `pdo_` extension to communicate with the database (it is used if the native extensions are not enabled). In browsers without CSP, Adminer versions 4.6.1 to 4.8.0 are affected. The vulnerability is patched in version 4.8.1. As workarounds, one can use a browser supporting strict CSP or enable the native PHP extensions (e.g. `mysqli`) or disable displaying PHP errors (`display_errors`).",

A malicious or buggy HVM guest may cause the hypervisor to crash, resulting in Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host. Xen versions from 4.8 onwards are affected. Xen versions 4.7 and earlier are not affected. Only x86 systems are affected. Arm systems are not affected. Only x86 HVM guests using shadow paging can leverage the vulnerability. In addition, there needs to be an entity actively monitoring a guest's video frame buffer (typically for display purposes) in order for such a guest to be able to leverage the vulnerability. x86 PV guests, as well as x86 HVM guests using hardware assisted paging (HAP), cannot leverage the vulnerability.",

Since SVG files support being parsed as HTML by browsers, this means that they could theoretically upload Javascript that would be executed on a path under the website's domain (i.e. /storage/app/media/evil.svg), but they would have to convince their target to visit that location directly in the target's browser as the backend does not display SVGs inline anywhere, SVGs are only displayed as image resources in the backend and are thus unable to be executed. Issue has been patched in Build 469 (v1.0.469) & v1.1.0.",

    "CVE编号": "CVE-2020-15092",
    "漏洞描述": "In TimelineJS before version 3.7.0, some user data renders as HTML. An attacker could implement an XSS exploit with maliciously crafted content in a number of data fields. This risk is present whether the source data for the timeline is stored on Google Sheets or in a JSON configuration file. Most TimelineJS users configure their timeline with a Google Sheets document. Those users are exposed to this vulnerability if they grant write access to the document to a malicious inside attacker, if the access of a trusted user is compromised, or if they grant public write access to the document. Some TimelineJS users configure their timeline with a JSON document. Those users are exposed to this vulnerability if they grant write access to the document to a malicious inside attacker, if the access of a trusted user is compromised, or if write access to the system hosting that document is otherwise compromised. Version 3.7.0 of TimelineJS addresses this in two ways. For content which is intended to support limited HTML markup for styling and linking, that content is \"sanitized\" before being added to the DOM. For content intended for simple text display, all markup is stripped. Very few users of TimelineJS actually install the TimelineJS code on their server. Most users publish a timeline using a URL hosted on systems we control. The fix for this issue is published to our system such that **those users will automatically begin using the new code**. The only exception would be users who have deliberately edited the embed URL to \"pin\" their timeline to an earlier version of the code. Some users of TimelineJS use it as a part of a wordpress plugin (knight-lab-timelinejs). Version 3.7.0.0 of that plugin and newer integrate the updated code. Users are encouraged to update the plugin rather than manually update the embedded version of TimelineJS.",
