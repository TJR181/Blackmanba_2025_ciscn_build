A vulnerability in versions prior to 5.1.5 allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML tags in the pages: \"experiments.php\" (show mode), \"database.php\" (show mode) or \"search.php\". It works by providing HTML code in the extended search string, which will then be displayed back to the user in the error message. This means that injected HTML will appear in a red \"alert/danger\" box, and be part of an error message. Due to some other security measures, it is not possible to execute arbitrary javascript from this attack. As such, this attack is deemed low impact. Users should upgrade to at least version 5.1.5 to receive a patch. No known workarounds are available.",

Sliver version 1.6.0 (prerelease) is vulnerable to RCE on the teamserver by a low-privileged \"operator\" user. The RCE is as the system root user. The exploit is pretty fun as we make the Sliver server pwn itself. As described in a past issue (#65), \"there is a clear security boundary between the operator and server, an operator should not inherently be able to run commands or code on the server.\" An operator who exploited this vulnerability would be able to view all console logs, kick all other operators, view and modify files stored on the server, and ultimately delete the server. This issue has not yet be addressed but is expected to be resolved before the full release of version 1.6.0. Users of the 1.6.0 prerelease should avoid using Silver in production.",

The problem is encoutered\nwith tests added by commit 38608ee7b690 (\"bpf, tests: Add load store\ntest case for tail call\")\n\nThis happens because tail call is done to a BPF prog with a different\nstack_depth. At the time being, the stack is kept as is when the caller\ntail calls its callee. But at exit, the callee restores the stack based\non its own properties. Therefore here, at each run, r1 is erroneously\nincreased by 32 - 16 = 16 bytes.\n\nThis was done that way in order to pass the tail call count from caller\nto callee through the stack. As powerpc32 doesn't have a red zone in\nthe stack, it was necessary the maintain the stack as is for the tail\ncall. But it was not anticipated that the BPF frame size could be\ndifferent.\n\nLet's take a new approach. Use register r4 to carry the tail call count\nduring the tail call, and save it into the stack at function entry if\nrequired. This means the input parameter must be in r3, which is more\ncorrect as it is a 32 bits parameter, then tail call better match with\nnormal BPF function entry, the down side being that we move that input\nparameter back and forth between r3 and r4. That can be optimised later.\n\nDoing that also has the advantage of maximising the common parts between\ntail calls and a normal function exit.\n\nWith the fix, tail call tests are now successfull:\n\n  test_bpf: #0 Tail call leaf jited:1 53 PASS\n  test_bpf: #1 Tail call 2 jited:1 115 PASS\n  test_bpf: #2 Tail call 3 jited:1 154 PASS\n  test_bpf: #3 Tail call 4 jited:1 165 PASS\n  test_bpf: #4 Tail call load/store leaf jited:1 101 PASS\n  test_bpf: #5 Tail call load/store jited:1 141 PASS\n  test_bpf: #6 Tail call error path, max count reached jited:1 994 PASS\n  test_bpf: #7 Tail call count preserved across function calls jited:1 140975 PASS\n  test_bpf: #8 Tail call error path, NULL target jited:1 110 PASS\n  test_bpf: #9 Tail call error path, index out of range jited:1 69 PASS\n  test_bpf: test_tail_calls: Summary: 10 PASSED, 0 FAILED, [10/10 JIT'ed]",
