    "漏洞描述": "File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit files. In version 2.32.0, the Command Execution feature of File Browser only allows the execution of shell command which have been predefined on a user-specific allowlist. Many tools allow the execution of arbitrary different commands, rendering this limitation void. The concrete impact depends on the commands being granted to the attacker, but the large number of standard commands allowing the execution of subcommands makes it likely that every user having the `Execute commands` permissions can exploit this vulnerability. Everyone who can exploit it will have full code execution rights with the uid of the server process. Until this issue is fixed, the maintainers recommend to completely disable `Execute commands` for all accounts. Since the command execution is an inherently dangerous feature that is not used by all deployments, it should be possible to completely disable it in the application's configuration. As a defense-in-depth measure, organizations not requiring command execution should operate the Filebrowser from a distroless container image. A patch version has been pushed to disable the feature for all existent installations, and making it opt-in. A warning has been added to the documentation and is printed on the console if the feature is enabled. Due to the project being in maintenance-only mode, the bug has not been fixed. The fix is tracked on pull request 5199.",

    "漏洞描述": "MobSF is a mobile application security testing tool used. Typically, MobSF is deployed on centralized internal or cloud-based servers that also host other security tools and web applications. Access to the MobSF web interface is often granted to internal security teams, audit teams, and external vendors.  MobSF provides a feature that allows users to upload ZIP files for static analysis. Upon upload, these ZIP files are automatically extracted and stored within the MobSF directory. However, in versions up to and including 4.3.2, this functionality lacks a check on the total uncompressed size of the ZIP file, making it vulnerable to a ZIP of Death (zip bomb) attack. Due to the absence of safeguards against oversized extractions, an attacker can craft a specially prepared ZIP file that is small in compressed form but expands to a massive size upon extraction. Exploiting this, an attacker can exhaust the server's disk space, leading to a complete denial of service (DoS) not just for MobSF, but also for any other applications or websites hosted on the same server. This vulnerability can lead to complete server disruption in an organization which can affect other internal portals and tools too (which are hosted on the same server). If some organization has created their customized cloud based mobile security tool using MobSF core then an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to crash their servers. Commit 6987a946485a795f4fd38cebdb4860b368a1995d fixes this issue. As an additional mitigation, it is recommended to implement a safeguard that checks the total uncompressed size of any uploaded ZIP file before extraction. If the estimated uncompressed size exceeds a safe threshold (e.g., 100 MB), MobSF should reject the file and notify the user.",

    "漏洞描述": "The WordPress CRM, Email & Marketing Automation for WordPress | Award Winner — Groundhogg plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the 'process_export_delete' and 'process_import_delete' functions in all versions up to, and including, 4.1.1.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).",

    "漏洞描述": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: dsa: clean up FDB, MDB, VLAN entries on unbind\n\nAs explained in many places such as commit b117e1e8a86d (\"net: dsa:\ndelete dsa_legacy_fdb_add and dsa_legacy_fdb_del\"), DSA is written given\nthe assumption that higher layers have balanced additions/deletions.\nAs such, it only makes sense to be extremely vocal when those\nassumptions are violated and the driver unbinds with entries still\npresent.\n\nBut Ido Schimmel points out a very simple situation where that is wrong:\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/netdev/ZDazSM5UsPPjQuKr@shredder/\n(also briefly discussed by me in the aforementioned commit).\n\nBasically, while the bridge bypass operations are not something that DSA\nexplicitly documents, and for the majority of DSA drivers this API\nsimply causes them to go to promiscuous mode, that isn't the case for\nall drivers. Some have the necessary requirements for bridge bypass\noperations to do something useful - see dsa_switch_supports_uc_filtering().\n\nAlthough in tools/testing/selftests/net/forwarding/local_termination.sh,\nwe made an effort to popularize better mechanisms to manage address\nfilters on DSA interfaces from user space - namely macvlan for unicast,\nand setsockopt(IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP) - through mtools - for multicast, the\nfact is that 'bridge fdb add ... self static local' also exists as\nkernel UAPI, and might be useful to someone, even if only for a quick\nhack.\n\nIt seems counter-productive to block that path by implementing shim\n.ndo_fdb_add and .ndo_fdb_del operations which just return -EOPNOTSUPP\nin order to prevent the ndo_dflt_fdb_add() and ndo_dflt_fdb_del() from\nrunning, although we could do that.\n\nAccepting that cleanup is necessary seems to be the only option.\nEspecially since we appear to be coming back at this from a different\nangle as well. Russell King is noticing that the WARN_ON() triggers even\nfor VLANs:\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/netdev/Z_li8Bj8bD4-BYKQ@shell.armlinux.org.uk/\n\nWhat happens in the bug report above is that dsa_port_do_vlan_del() fails,\nthen the VLAN entry lingers on, and then we warn on unbind and leak it.\n\nThis is not a straight revert of the blamed commit, but we now add an\ninformational print to the kernel log (to still have a way to see\nthat bugs exist), and some extra comments gathered from past years'\nexperience, to justify the logic.",

    "漏洞描述": "Conda-build contains commands and tools to build conda packages. Prior to version 25.4.0, the conda-build recipe processing logic has been found to be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to unsafe evaluation of recipe selectors. Currently, conda-build uses the eval function to process embedded selectors in meta.yaml files. This approach evaluates user-defined expressions without proper sanitization, which allows arbitrary code to be executed during the build process. As a result, the integrity of the build environment is compromised, and unauthorized commands or file operations may be performed. The vulnerability stems from the inherent risk of using eval() on untrusted input in a context intended to control dynamic build configurations. By directly interpreting selector expressions, conda-build creates a potential execution pathway for malicious code, violating security assumptions. This issue has been patched in version 25.4.0.",

    "漏洞描述": "Conda-build contains commands and tools to build conda packages. Prior to version 25.3.1, the write_build_scripts function in conda-build creates the temporary build script conda_build.sh with overly permissive file permissions (0o766), allowing write access to all users. Attackers with filesystem access can exploit a race condition to overwrite the script before execution, enabling arbitrary code execution under the victim's privileges. This risk is significant in shared environments, potentially leading to full system compromise. Even with non-static directory names, attackers can monitor parent directories for file creation events. The brief window between script creation (with insecure permissions) and execution allows rapid overwrites. Directory names can also be inferred via timestamps or logs, and automation enables exploitation even with semi-randomized paths by acting within milliseconds of detection. This issue has been patched in version 25.3.1. A workaround involves restricting conda_build.sh permissions from 0o766 to 0o700 (owner-only read/write/execute). Additionally, use atomic file creation (write to a temporary randomized filename and rename atomically) to minimize the race condition window.",

This allows session token replacement for applications hosted on sibling subdomains (e.g., `community.host.com`) if session tokens aren't rotated post-authentication. Key Constraints are that the attacker must control any subdomain under the parent domain (e.g., `evil.host.com` or `x.y.host.com`), and the parent domain must not be on the Public Suffix List. Due to non-existent session token rotation after authenticating we can theoretically reproduce the vulnerability by using browser dev tools, but due to the browser's security measures this does not seem to be exploitable as described.

    "CVE编号": "CVE-2025-21605",
    "漏洞描述": "Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. In versions starting at 2.6 and prior to 7.4.3, An unauthenticated client can cause unlimited growth of output buffers, until the server runs out of memory or is killed. By default, the Redis configuration does not limit the output buffer of normal clients (see client-output-buffer-limit). Therefore, the output buffer can grow unlimitedly over time. As a result, the service is exhausted and the memory is unavailable. When password authentication is enabled on the Redis server, but no password is provided, the client can still cause the output buffer to grow from \"NOAUTH\" responses until the system will run out of memory. This issue has been patched in version 7.4.3. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable is to block access to prevent unauthenticated users from connecting to Redis. This can be done in different ways. Either using network access control tools like firewalls, iptables, security groups, etc, or enabling TLS and requiring users to authenticate using client side certificates.",

    "漏洞描述": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfix bitmap corruption on close_range() with CLOSE_RANGE_UNSHARE\n\ncopy_fd_bitmaps(new, old, count) is expected to copy the first\ncount/BITS_PER_LONG bits from old->full_fds_bits[] and fill\nthe rest with zeroes.  What it does is copying enough words\n(BITS_TO_LONGS(count/BITS_PER_LONG)), then memsets the rest.\nThat works fine, *if* all bits past the cutoff point are\nclear.  Otherwise we are risking garbage from the last word\nwe'd copied.\n\nFor most of the callers that is true - expand_fdtable() has\ncount equal to old->max_fds, so there's no open descriptors\npast count, let alone fully occupied words in ->open_fds[],\nwhich is what bits in ->full_fds_bits[] correspond to.\n\nThe other caller (dup_fd()) passes sane_fdtable_size(old_fdt, max_fds),\nwhich is the smallest multiple of BITS_PER_LONG that covers all\nopened descriptors below max_fds.  In the common case (copying on\nfork()) max_fds is ~0U, so all opened descriptors will be below\nit and we are fine, by the same reasons why the call in expand_fdtable()\nis safe.\n\nUnfortunately, there is a case where max_fds is less than that\nand where we might, indeed, end up with junk in ->full_fds_bits[] -\nclose_range(from, to, CLOSE_RANGE_UNSHARE) with\n\t* descriptor table being currently shared\n\t* 'to' being above the current capacity of descriptor table\n\t* 'from' being just under some chunk of opened descriptors.\nIn that case we end up with observably wrong behaviour - e.g. spawn\na child with CLONE_FILES, get all descriptors in range 0..127 open,\nthen close_range(64, ~0U, CLOSE_RANGE_UNSHARE) and watch dup(0) ending\nup with descriptor #128, despite #64 being observably not open.\n\nThe minimally invasive fix would be to deal with that in dup_fd().\nIf this proves to add measurable overhead, we can go that way, but\nlet's try to fix copy_fd_bitmaps() first.\n\n* new helper: bitmap_copy_and_expand(to, from, bits_to_copy, size).\n* make copy_fd_bitmaps() take the bitmap size in words, rather than\nbits; it's 'count' argument is always a multiple of BITS_PER_LONG,\nso we are not losing any information, and that way we can use the\nsame helper for all three bitmaps - compiler will see that count\nis a multiple of BITS_PER_LONG for the large ones, so it'll generate\nplain memcpy()+memset().\n\nReproducer added to tools/testing/selftests/core/close_range_test.c",

    "CVE编号": "CVE-2024-43891",
    "漏洞描述": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntracing: Have format file honor EVENT_FILE_FL_FREED\n\nWhen eventfs was introduced, special care had to be done to coordinate the\nfreeing of the file meta data with the files that are exposed to user\nspace. The file meta data would have a ref count that is set when the file\nis created and would be decremented and freed after the last user that\nopened the file closed it. When the file meta data was to be freed, it\nwould set a flag (EVENT_FILE_FL_FREED) to denote that the file is freed,\nand any new references made (like new opens or reads) would fail as it is\nmarked freed. This allowed other meta data to be freed after this flag was\nset (under the event_mutex).\n\nAll the files that were dynamically created in the events directory had a\npointer to the file meta data and would call event_release() when the last\nreference to the user space file was closed. This would be the time that it\nis safe to free the file meta data.\n\nA shortcut was made for the \"format\" file. It's i_private would point to\nthe \"call\" entry directly and not point to the file's meta data. This is\nbecause all format files are the same for the same \"call\", so it was\nthought there was no reason to differentiate them.  The other files\nmaintain state (like the \"enable\", \"trigger\", etc). But this meant if the\nfile were to disappear, the \"format\" file would be unaware of it.\n\nThis caused a race that could be trigger via the user_events test (that\nwould create dynamic events and free them), and running a loop that would\nread the user_events format files:\n\nIn one console run:\n\n # cd tools/testing/selftests/user_events\n # while true; do ./ftrace_test; done\n\nAnd in another console run:\n\n # cd /sys/kernel/tracing/\n # while true; do cat events/user_events/__test_event/format; done 2>/dev/null\n\nWith KASAN memory checking, it would trigger a use-after-free bug report\n(which was a real bug). This was because the format file was not checking\nthe file's meta data flag \"EVENT_FILE_FL_FREED\", so it would access the\nevent that the file meta data pointed to after the event was freed.\n\nAfter inspection, there are other locations that were found to not check\nthe EVENT_FILE_FL_FREED flag when accessing the trace_event_file. Add a\nnew helper function: event_file_file() that will make sure that the\nevent_mutex is held, and will return NULL if the trace_event_file has the\nEVENT_FILE_FL_FREED flag set. Have the first reference of the struct file\npointer use event_file_file() and check for NULL. Later uses can still use\nthe event_file_data() helper function if the event_mutex is still held and\nwas not released since the event_file_file() call.",

All of them use the resource URL, and there are currently no checks to limit what URLs can be requested. This means that a malicious (or unaware) user can create a resource with a URL pointing to a place where they should not have access in order for one of the previous tools to retrieve it (known as a Server Side Request Forgery). Users wanting to protect against these kinds of attacks can use one or a combination of the following approaches: (1) Use a separate HTTP proxy like Squid that can be used to allow / disallow IPs, domains etc as needed, and make CKAN extensions aware of this setting via the ckan.download_proxy config option. (2) Implement custom firewall rules to prevent access to restricted resources. (3) Use custom validators on the resource url field to block/allow certain domains or IPs. All latest versions of the plugins listed above support the ckan.download_proxy settings. Support for this setting in the Resource Proxy plugin was included in CKAN 2.10.5 and 2.11.0.",

Versions 31.2, 30.4, and 29.6 contain a fix for this issue. As a workaround, GeoTools can operate with reduced functionality by removing the `gt-complex` jar from one's application. As an example of the impact, application schema `datastore` would not function without the ability to use XPath expressions to query complex content. Alternatively, one may utilize a drop-in replacement GeoTools jar from SourceForge for versions 31.1, 30.3, 30.2, 29.2, 28.2, 27.5, 27.4, 26.7, 26.4, 25.2, and 24.0.

One may identify and block potentially malicious software executed path interception by using application control tools, like Windows Defender Application Control, AppLocker, or Software Restriction Policies where appropriate.

Then, we should\nrather fix the issue at the VMA level, not in i915_active.\n\nSince __i915_vma_parked() is called from __gt_park() on last put of the\nGT's wakeref, the issue could be addressed by holding the GT wakeref long\nenough for __active_retire() to complete before that wakeref is released\nand the GT parked.\n\nI believe the issue was introduced by commit d93939730347 (\"drm/i915:\nRemove the vma refcount\") which moved a call to i915_active_fini() from\na dropped i915_vma_release(), called on last put of the removed VMA kref,\nto i915_vma_parked() processing path called on last put of a GT wakeref.\nHowever, its visibility to the object debugging tool was suppressed by a\nbug in i915_active that was fixed two weeks later with commit e92eb246feb9\n(\"drm/i915/active: Fix missing debug object activation\").\n\nA VMA associated with a request doesn't acquire a GT wakeref by itself.\nInstead, it depends on a wakeref held directly by the request's active\nintel_context for a GT associated with its VM, and indirectly on that\nintel_context's engine wakeref if the engine belongs to the same GT as the\nVMA's VM.  Those wakerefs are released asynchronously to VMA deactivation.\n\nFix the issue by getting a wakeref for the VMA's GT when activating it,\nand putting that wakeref only after the VMA is deactivated.  However,\nexclude global GTT from that processing path, otherwise the GPU never goes\nidle.  Since __i915_vma_retire() may be called from atomic contexts, use\nasync variant of wakeref put.  Also, to avoid circular locking dependency,\ntake care of acquiring the wakeref before VM mutex when both are needed.\n\nv7: Add inline comments with justifications for:\n    - using untracked variants of intel_gt_pm_get/put() (Nirmoy),\n    - using async variant of _put(),\n    - not getting the wakeref in case of a global GTT,\n    - always getting the first wakeref outside vm->mutex.\nv6: Since __i915_vma_active/retire() callbacks are not serialized, storing\n    a wakeref tracking handle inside struct i915_vma is not safe, and\n    there is no other good place for that.  Use untracked variants of\n    intel_gt_pm_get/put_async().\nv5: Replace \"tile\" with \"GT\" across commit description (Rodrigo),\n  - \n---truncated---",

So, we set the\nDMF_SUSPENDED flag and we fake normal suspend - it may confuse userspace\ntools, but it won't cause a kernel crash.\n\n------------[ cut here ]------------\nkernel BUG at lib/list_debug.c:56!\ninvalid opcode: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\nCPU: 1 PID: 8343 Comm: dmsetup Not tainted 6.8.0-rc6 #4\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.14.0-2 04/01/2014\nRIP: 0010:__list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0\n<snip>\nRSP: 0018:ffff8881b831bcc0 EFLAGS: 00010282\nRAX: 000000000000004e RBX: ffff888143b6eb80 RCX: 0000000000000000\nRDX: 0000000000000001 RSI: ffffffff819053d0 RDI: 00000000ffffffff\nRBP: ffff8881b83a3400 R08: 00000000fffeffff R09: 0000000000000058\nR10: 0000000000000000 R11: ffffffff81a24080 R12: 0000000000000001\nR13: ffff88814538e000 R14: ffff888143bc6dc0 R15: ffffffffa02e4bb0\nFS:  00000000f7c0f780(0000) GS:ffff8893f0a40000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\nCS:  0010 DS: 002b ES: 002b CR0: 0000000080050033\nCR2: 0000000057fb5000 CR3: 0000000143474000 CR4: 00000000000006b0\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n ? die+0x2d/0x80\n ? do_trap+0xeb/0xf0\n ? __list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0\n ? do_error_trap+0x60/0x80\n ? __list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0\n ? exc_invalid_op+0x49/0x60\n ? __list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0\n ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x16/0x20\n ? table_deps+0x1b0/0x1b0 [dm_mod]\n ? __list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0\n origin_postsuspend+0x1a/0x50 [dm_snapshot]\n dm_table_postsuspend_targets+0x34/0x50 [dm_mod]\n dm_suspend+0xd8/0xf0 [dm_mod]\n dev_suspend+0x1f2/0x2f0 [dm_mod]\n ? table_deps+0x1b0/0x1b0 [dm_mod]\n ctl_ioctl+0x300/0x5f0 [dm_mod]\n dm_compat_ctl_ioctl+0x7/0x10 [dm_mod]\n __x64_compat_sys_ioctl+0x104/0x170\n do_syscall_64+0x184/0x1b0\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x46/0x4e\nRIP: 0033:0xf7e6aead\n<snip>\n---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---",

In the standard API, if the URL contains `..`, here called \"double dots\", the URL string returned by Request will be in the resolved path. However, the `url` in @hono/node-server's Request as does not resolve double dots, so `http://localhost/static/.. /foo.txt` is returned. This causes vulnerabilities when using `serveStatic`. Modern web browsers and a latest `curl` command resolve double dots on the client side, so this issue doesn't affect those using either of those tools. However, problems may occur if accessed by a client that does not resolve them. Version 1.4.1 includes the change to fix this issue. As a workaround, don't use `serveStatic`.\n\n",

    "漏洞描述": "The Notary Project is a set of specifications and tools intended to provide a cross-industry standard for securing software supply chains by using authentic container images and other OCI artifacts. An external actor with control of a compromised container registry can provide outdated versions of OCI artifacts, such as Images. This could lead artifact consumers with relaxed trust policies (such as `permissive` instead of `strict`) to potentially use artifacts with signatures that are no longer valid, making them susceptible to any exploits those artifacts may contain. In Notary Project, an artifact publisher can control the validity period of artifact by specifying signature expiry during the signing process. Using shorter signature validity periods along with processes to periodically resign artifacts, allows artifact producers to ensure that their consumers will only receive up-to-date artifacts. Artifact consumers should correspondingly use a `strict` or equivalent trust policy that enforces signature expiry. Together these steps enable use of up-to-date artifacts and safeguard against rollback attack in the event of registry compromise. The Notary Project offers various signature validation options such as `permissive`, `audit` and `skip` to support various scenarios. These scenarios includes 1) situations demanding urgent workload deployment, necessitating the bypassing of expired or revoked signatures; 2) auditing of artifacts lacking signatures without interrupting workload; and 3) skipping of verification for specific images that might have undergone validation through alternative mechanisms. Additionally, the Notary Project supports revocation to ensure the signature freshness. Artifact publishers can sign with short-lived certificates and revoke older certificates when necessary. This revocation serves as a signal to inform artifact consumers that the corresponding unexpired artifact is no longer approved by the publisher. This enables the artifact publisher to control the validity of the signature independently of their ability to manage artifacts in a compromised registry.",

Prior to 1.0.1, WP-Mobile-BankID-Integration is affected by a vulnerability classified as a Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability, specifically impacting scenarios where an attacker can manipulate the database. If unauthorized actors gain access to the database, they could exploit this vulnerability to execute object injection attacks. This could lead to unauthorized code execution, data manipulation, or data exfiltration within the WordPress environment.  Users of the plugin should upgrade to version 1.0.1 (or later), where the serialization and deserialization of OrderResponse objects have been switched out to an array stored as JSON.  A possible workaround for users unable to upgrade immediately is to enforce stricter access controls on the database, ensuring that only trusted and authorized entities can modify data. Additionally, implementing monitoring tools to detect unusual database activities could help identify and mitigate potential exploitation attempts.\n",

    "漏洞描述": "The XWiki Admin Tools Application provides tools to help the administration of XWiki. Prior to version 4.5.1, a cross-site request forgery vulnerability in the query on XWiki tool allows executing arbitrary database queries on the database of the XWiki installation. Among other things, this allows modifying and deleting all data of the wiki. This could be both used to damage the wiki and to create an account with elevated privileges for the attacker, thus impacting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki instance.

This has been patched in Admin Tools Application 4.5.1 by adding form token checks. Some workarounds are available. The patch can also be applied manually to the affected pages. Alternatively, if the query tool is not needed, by deleting the document `Admin.SQLToolsGroovy`, all database query tools can be deactivated.",

    "漏洞描述": "The XWiki Admin Tools Application provides tools to help the administration of XWiki. Starting in version 4.4 and prior to version 4.5.1, a cross site request forgery vulnerability in the admin tool for executing shell commands on the server allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands by tricking an admin into loading the URL with the shell command. A very simple possibility for an attack are comments. When the attacker can leave a comment on any page in the wiki it is sufficient to include an image with an URL like  `/xwiki/bin/view/Admin/RunShellCommand?command=touch%20/tmp/attacked` in the comment. When an admin views the comment, the file `/tmp/attacked` will be created on the server. The output of the command is also vulnerable to XWiki syntax injection which offers a simple way to execute Groovy in the context of the XWiki installation and thus an even easier way to compromise the integrity and confidentiality of the whole XWiki installation. This has been patched by adding a form token check in version 4.5.1 of the admin tools. Some workarounds are available. The patch can be applied manually to the affected wiki pages. Alternatively, the document `Admin.RunShellCommand` can also be deleted if the possibility to run shell commands isn't needed.",

    "漏洞描述": "OpenPGP.js is a JavaScript implementation of the OpenPGP protocol. In affected versions OpenPGP Cleartext Signed Messages are cryptographically signed messages where the signed text is readable without special tools. These messages typically contain a \"Hash: ...\" header declaring the hash algorithm used to compute the signature digest. OpenPGP.js up to v5.9.0 ignored any data preceding the \"Hash: ...\" texts when verifying the signature. As a result, malicious parties could add arbitrary text to a third-party Cleartext Signed Message, to lead the victim to believe that the arbitrary text was signed. A user or application is vulnerable to said attack vector if it verifies the CleartextMessage by only checking the returned `verified` property, discarding the associated `data` information, and instead _visually trusting_ the contents of the original message. Since `verificationResult.data` would always contain the actual signed data, users and apps that check this information are not vulnerable. Similarly, given a CleartextMessage object, retrieving the data using `getText()` or the `text` field returns only the contents that are considered when verifying the signature. Finally, re-armoring a CleartextMessage object (using `armor()` will also result in a \"sanitised\" version, with the extraneous text being removed. This issue has been addressed in version 5.10.1 (current stable version) which will reject messages when calling `openpgp.readCleartextMessage()` and in version 4.10.11 (legacy version) which will will reject messages when calling `openpgp.cleartext.readArmored()`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should check the contents of `verificationResult.data` to see what data was actually signed, rather than visually trusting the contents of the armored message.",

Note that earlier stable branches (1.0.x .. 2.18.x) have been EOLd already and do not receive updates anymore.\n\nIn general, RMI support can expose vulnerabilities by the mere presence of an exploitable class on the classpath. Even if Jackrabbit itself does not contain any code known to be exploitable anymore, adding other components to your server can expose the same type of problem. We therefore recommend to disable RMI access altogether (see further below), and will discuss deprecating RMI support in future Jackrabbit releases.\n\nHow to check whether RMI support is enabledRMI support can be over an RMI-specific TCP port, and over an HTTP binding. Both are by default enabled in Jackrabbit webapp/standalone.\n\nThe native RMI protocol by default uses port 1099. To check whether it is enabled, tools like \"netstat\" can be used to check.\n\nRMI-over-HTTP in Jackrabbit by default uses the path \"/rmi\". So when running standalone on port 8080, check whether an HTTP GET request on localhost:8080/rmi returns 404 (not enabled) or 200 (enabled). Note that the HTTP path may be different when the webapp is deployed in a container as non-root context, in which case the prefix is under the user's control.\n\nTurning off RMIFind web.xml (either in JAR/WAR file or in unpacked web application folder), and remove the declaration and the mapping definition for the RemoteBindingServlet:\n\n        <servlet>\n            <servlet-name>RMI</servlet-name>\n            <servlet-class>org.apache.jackrabbit.servlet.remote.RemoteBindingServlet</servlet-class>\n        </servlet>\n\n        <servlet-mapping>\n            <servlet-name>RMI</servlet-name>\n            <url-pattern>/rmi</url-pattern>\n        </servlet-mapping>\n\nFind the bootstrap.properties file (in $REPOSITORY_HOME), and set\n\n         rmi.enabled=false\n\n    and also remove\n\n         rmi.host\n         rmi.port\n         rmi.url-pattern\n\n If there is no file named bootstrap.properties in $REPOSITORY_HOME, it is located somewhere in the classpath.

    "CVE编号": "CVE-2023-35934",
    "漏洞描述": "yt-dlp is a command-line program to download videos from video sites. During file downloads, yt-dlp or the external downloaders that yt-dlp employs may leak cookies on HTTP redirects to a different host, or leak them when the host for download fragments differs from their parent manifest's host. This vulnerable behavior is present in yt-dlp prior to 2023.07.06 and nightly 2023.07.06.185519. All native and external downloaders are affected, except for `curl` and `httpie` (version 3.1.0 or later).\n\nAt the file download stage, all cookies are passed by yt-dlp to the file downloader as a `Cookie` header, thereby losing their scope. This also occurs in yt-dlp's info JSON output, which may be used by external tools. As a result, the downloader or external tool may indiscriminately send cookies with requests to domains or paths for which the cookies are not scoped.\n\nyt-dlp version 2023.07.06 and nightly 2023.07.06.185519 fix this issue by removing the `Cookie` header upon HTTP redirects; having native downloaders calculate the `Cookie` header from the cookiejar, utilizing external downloaders' built-in support for cookies instead of passing them as header arguments, disabling HTTP redirectiong if the external downloader does not have proper cookie support, processing cookies passed as HTTP headers to limit their scope, and having a separate field for cookies in the info dict storing more information about scoping\n\nSome workarounds are available for those who are unable to upgrade. Avoid using cookies and user authentication methods. While extractors may set custom cookies, these usually do not contain sensitive information. Alternatively, avoid using `--load-info-json`. Or, if authentication is a must: verify the integrity of download links from unknown sources in browser (including redirects) before passing them to yt-dlp; use `curl` as external downloader, since it is not impacted; and/or avoid fragmented formats such as HLS/m3u8, DASH/mpd and ISM.",

    "漏洞描述": "Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. Prior to versions 6.0.2, 7.0.1, and 8.0.1, Wasmtime's implementation of managing per-instance state, such as tables and memories, contains LLVM-level undefined behavior. This undefined behavior was found to cause runtime-level issues when compiled with LLVM 16 which causes some writes, which are critical for correctness, to be optimized away. Vulnerable versions of Wasmtime compiled with Rust 1.70, which is currently in beta, or later are known to have incorrectly compiled functions. Versions of Wasmtime compiled with the current Rust stable release, 1.69, and prior are not known at this time to have any issues, but can theoretically exhibit potential issues.\n\nThe underlying problem is that Wasmtime's runtime state for an instance involves a Rust-defined structure called `Instance` which has a trailing `VMContext` structure after it. This `VMContext` structure has a runtime-defined layout that is unique per-module. This representation cannot be expressed with safe code in Rust so `unsafe` code is required to maintain this state. The code doing this, however, has methods which take `&self` as an argument but modify data in the `VMContext` part of the allocation. This means that pointers derived from `&self` are mutated. This is typically not allowed, except in the presence of `UnsafeCell`, in Rust. When compiled to LLVM these functions have `noalias readonly` parameters which means it's UB to write through the pointers.\n\nWasmtime's internal representation and management of `VMContext` has been updated to use `&mut self` methods where appropriate. Additionally verification tools for `unsafe` code in Rust, such as `cargo miri`, are planned to be executed on the `main` branch soon to fix any Rust-level issues that may be exploited in future compiler versions.\n\nPrecomplied binaries available for Wasmtime from GitHub releases have been compiled with at most LLVM 15 so are not known to be vulnerable. As mentioned above, however, it's still recommended to update.\n\nWasmtime version 6.0.2, 7.0.1, and 8.0.1 have been issued which contain the patch necessary to work correctly on LLVM 16 and have no known UB on LLVM 15 and earlier. If Wasmtime is compiled with Rust 1.69 and prior, which use LLVM 15, then there are no known issues. There is a theoretical possibility for undefined behavior to exploited, however, so it's recommended that users upgrade to a patched version of Wasmtime. Users using beta Rust (1.70 at this time) or nightly Rust (1.71 at this time) must update to a patched version to work correctly.",

In GoCD versions from 20.5.0 and below 23.1.0, if the server environment is not correctly configured by administrators to provide access to the relevant PostgreSQL or MySQL backup tools, the credentials for database access may be unintentionally leaked to admin alerts on the GoCD user interface. The vulnerability is triggered only if the GoCD server host is misconfigured to have backups enabled, but does not have access to the `pg_dump` or `mysqldump` utility tools to backup the configured database type (PostgreSQL or MySQL respectively). In such cases, failure to launch the expected backup utility reports the shell environment used to attempt to launch in the server admin alert, which includes the plaintext database password supplied to the configured tool. This vulnerability does not affect backups of the default on-disk H2 database that GoCD is configured to use. This issue has been addressed and fixed in GoCD 23.1.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable backups, or administrators should ensure that the required `pg_dump` (PostgreSQL) or `mysqldump` (MySQL) binaries are available on the GoCD server when backups are triggered.",

    "漏洞描述": "Rundeck is an open source automation service with a web console, command line tools and a WebAPI. Rundeck community and rundeck-enterprise docker images contained a pre-generated SSH keypair. If the id_rsa.pub public key of the keypair was copied to authorized_keys files on remote host, those hosts would allow access to anyone with the exposed private credentials. This misconfiguration only impacts Rundeck Docker instances of PagerDuty® Process Automation On Prem (formerly Rundeck) version 4.0 and earlier, not Debian, RPM or .WAR. Additionally, the id_rsa.pub file would have to be copied from the Docker image filesystem contents without overwriting it and used to configure SSH access on a host. A patch on Rundeck's `main` branch has removed the pre-generated SSH key pair, but it does not remove exposed keys that have been configured. To patch, users must run a script on hosts in their environment to search for exposed keys and rotate them. Two workarounds are available: Do not use any pre-existing public key file from the rundeck docker images to allow SSH access by adding it to authorized_keys files and, if you have copied the public key file included in the docker image, remove it from any authorized_keys files.",

The profile editor tool has an edit profile functionality, the parameters on this page are not properly sanitized and hence leads to stored XSS attacks. An authenticated user can store XSS payloads in the profiles, which gets triggered when any other user try to access the edit profile page. The pdf editor tool has an edit pdf profile functionality, the logoFile parameter in it is not properly sanitized and an user can enter relative paths like ../../../../../../../../../../../../../usr/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps/gvim.png via tools like burpsuite. Later when a pdf is exported using the edited profile the pdf icon has the image on that path(if image is present). Both issues require an attacker to be able to login to LAM admin interface.

In such scenarios, every\nincoming packet will leak an allocation in `ip6_dst_cache` slab cache.\n\nAfter some hours of `bpftrace`-ing and source code reading, I tracked\ndown the issue to ca7a03c41753 (\"ipv6: do not free rt if\nFIB_LOOKUP_NOREF is set on suppress rule\").\n\nThe problem with that change is that the generic `args->flags` always have\n`FIB_LOOKUP_NOREF` set[1][2] but the IPv6-specific flag\n`RT6_LOOKUP_F_DST_NOREF` might not be, leading to `fib6_rule_suppress` not\ndecreasing the refcount when needed.\n\nHow to reproduce:\n - Add the following nftables rule to a prerouting chain:\n     meta nfproto ipv6 fib saddr . mark . iif oif missing drop\n   This can be done with:\n     sudo nft create table inet test\n     sudo nft create chain inet test test_chain '{ type filter hook prerouting priority filter + 10; policy accept; }'\n     sudo nft add rule inet test test_chain meta nfproto ipv6 fib saddr . mark . iif oif missing drop\n - Run:\n     sudo ip -6 rule add table main suppress_prefixlength 0\n - Watch `sudo slabtop -o | grep ip6_dst_cache` to see memory usage increase\n   with every incoming ipv6 packet.\n\nThis patch exposes the protocol-specific flags to the protocol\nspecific `suppress` function, and check the protocol-specific `flags`\nargument for RT6_LOOKUP_F_DST_NOREF instead of the generic\nFIB_LOOKUP_NOREF when decreasing the refcount, like this.\n\n[1]: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/ca7a03c4175366a92cee0ccc4fec0038c3266e26/net/ipv6/fib6_rules.c#L71\n[2]: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/ca7a03c4175366a92cee0ccc4fec0038c3266e26/net/ipv6/fib6_rules.c#L99",

Triggering this was not via some hypothetical\n     corner case, but with existing tools like runqlat & runqslower from bcc, for\n     example, which make use of this tracepoint. Rough call sequence goes like:\n\n     rq_lock(rq) -> -------------------------+\n       trace_sched_switch() ->               |\n         bpf_prog_xyz() ->                   +-> deadlock\n           selinux_lockdown() ->             |\n             audit_log_end() ->              |\n               wake_up_interruptible() ->    |\n                 try_to_wake_up() ->         |\n                   rq_lock(rq) --------------+\n\nWhat's worse is that the intention of 59438b46471a to further restrict lockdown\nsettings for specific applications in respect to the global lockdown policy is\ncompletely broken for BPF. The SELinux policy rule for the current lockdown check\nlooks something like this:\n\n  allow <who> <who> : lockdown { <reason> };\n\nHowever, this doesn't match with the 'current' task where the security_locked_down()\nis executed, example: httpd does a syscall. There is a tracing program attached\nto the syscall which triggers a BPF program to run, which ends up doing a\nbpf_probe_read_kernel{,_str}() helper call. The selinux_lockdown() hook does\nthe permission check against 'current', that is, httpd in this example. httpd\nhas literally zero relation to this tracing program, and it would be nonsensical\nhaving to write an SELinux policy rule against httpd to let the tracing helper\npass. The policy in this case needs to be against the entity that is installing\nthe BPF program. For example, if bpftrace would generate a histogram of syscall\ncounts by user space application:\n\n  bpftrace -e 'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'\n\nbpftrace would then go and generate a BPF program from this internally. One way\nof doing it [for the sake of the example] could be to call bpf_get_current_task()\nhelper and then access current->comm via one of bpf_probe_read_kernel{,_str}()\nhelpers. So the program itself has nothing to do with httpd or any other random\napp doing a syscall here. The BPF program _explicitly initiated_ the lockdown\ncheck. The allow/deny policy belongs in the context of bpftrace: meaning, you\nwant to grant bpftrace access to use these helpers, but other tracers on the\nsystem like my_random_tracer _not_.\n\nTherefore fix all three issues at the same time by taking a completely different\napproach for the security_locked_down() hook, that is, move the check into the\nprogram verification phase where we actually retrieve the BPF func proto. This\nalso reliably gets the task (current) that is trying to install the BPF tracing\nprogram, e.g. bpftrace/bcc/perf/systemtap/etc, and it also fixes the OOM since\nwe're moving this out of the BPF helper's fast-path which can be called several\nmillions of times per second.\n\nThe check is then also in line with other security_locked_down() hooks in the\nsystem where the enforcement is performed at open/load time, for example,\nopen_kcore() for /proc/kcore access or module_sig_check() for module signatures\njust to pick f\n---truncated---",

To be vulnerable, a OneFuzz deployment must be both version 2.12.0 or greater and deployed with the non-default --multi_tenant_domain option. This can result in read/write access to private data such as software vulnerability and crash information, security testing tools and proprietary code and symbols. Via authorized API calls, this also enables tampering with existing data and unauthorized code execution on Azure compute resources. This issue is resolved starting in release 2.31.0, via the addition of application-level check of the bearer token's `issuer` against an administrator-configured allowlist. As a workaround users can restrict access to the tenant of a deployed OneFuzz instance < 2.31.0 by redeploying in the default configuration, which omits the `--multi_tenant_domain` option.",

    "漏洞描述": "Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. When parsing an incoming Redis Standard Protocol (RESP) request, Redis allocates memory according to user-specified values which determine the number of elements (in the multi-bulk header) and size of each element (in the bulk header). An attacker delivering specially crafted requests over multiple connections can cause the server to allocate significant amount of memory. Because the same parsing mechanism is used to handle authentication requests, this vulnerability can also be exploited by unauthenticated users. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable is to block access to prevent unauthenticated users from connecting to Redis. This can be done in different ways: Using network access control tools like firewalls, iptables, security groups, etc. or Enabling TLS and requiring users to authenticate using client side certificates.",

Specifically crafted URL values allow code to be executed in the HgDriver if hg/Mercurial is installed on the system. The impact to Composer users directly is limited as the composer.json file is typically under their own control and source download URLs can only be supplied by third party Composer repositories they explicitly trust to download and execute source code from, e.g. Composer plugins. The main impact is to services passing user input to Composer, including Packagist.org and Private Packagist. This allowed users to trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability has been patched on Packagist.org and Private Packagist within 12h of receiving the initial vulnerability report and based on a review of logs, to the best of our knowledge, was not abused by anyone. Other services/tools using VcsRepository/VcsDriver or derivatives may also be vulnerable and should upgrade their composer/composer dependency immediately. Versions 1.10.22 and 2.0.13 include patches for this issue.",

    "漏洞描述": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. A guest may access xenstore paths via absolute paths containing a full pathname, or via a relative path, which implicitly includes /local/domain/$DOMID for their own domain id. Management tools must access paths in guests' namespaces, necessarily using absolute paths. oxenstored imposes a pathname limit that is applied solely to the relative or absolute path specified by the client. Therefore, a guest can create paths in its own namespace which are too long for management tools to access. Depending on the toolstack in use, a malicious guest administrator might cause some management tools and debugging operations to fail. For example, a guest administrator can cause \"xenstore-ls -r\" to fail. However, a guest administrator cannot prevent the host administrator from tearing down the domain. All systems using oxenstored are vulnerable. Building and using oxenstored is the default in the upstream Xen distribution, if the Ocaml compiler is available. Systems using C xenstored are not vulnerable.",

    "漏洞描述": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Access rights of Xenstore nodes are per domid. Unfortunately, existing granted access rights are not removed when a domain is being destroyed. This means that a new domain created with the same domid will inherit the access rights to Xenstore nodes from the previous domain(s) with the same domid. Because all Xenstore entries of a guest below /local/domain/<domid> are being deleted by Xen tools when a guest is destroyed, only Xenstore entries of other guests still running are affected. For example, a newly created guest domain might be able to read sensitive information that had belonged to a previously existing guest domain. Both Xenstore implementations (C and Ocaml) are vulnerable.",

    "CVE编号": "CVE-2020-1971",
    "漏洞描述": "The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2x (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2w).",

The N-Central JSESSIONID cookie attribute is not checked against multiple sources such as sourceip, MFA claim, etc. as long as the victim stays logged in within N-Central. To take advantage of this, cookie could be stolen and the JSESSIONID can be captured. On its own this is not a surprising result; low security tools allow the cookie to roam from machine to machine. The JSESSION cookie can then be used on the attackers’ workstation by browsing to the victim’s NCentral server URL and replacing the JSESSIONID attribute value by the captured value. Expected behavior would be to check this against a second source and enforce at least a reauthentication or multi factor request as N-Central is a highly privileged service.",
