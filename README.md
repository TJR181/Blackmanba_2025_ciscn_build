## 📚 Knowledge Base Task  

### Goal  
Build two structured knowledge bases:

- **Network Hardware Vulnerabilities**  
  - Brands: Cisco, TP-LINK, NETGEAR, ASUS, D-Link, etc.  
  - Devices: Routers, Switches, Firewalls, IDS/IPS, Automotive systems  
  - Fields: CVE ID, Description, Attack Vector, Patch Link, etc.  
  - ✅ Minimum: 50 entries  

- **LLM Security Vulnerabilities**  
  - Models: ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Llama, 文心一言, etc.  
  - Attack Types: Prompt Injection, Jailbreak, Command Injection  
  - Fields: Attack Name, Description, PoC, Mitigation, etc.  
  - ✅ Minimum: 30 entries  

### Output  
Excel file with 2 sheets:  
- `Sheet1`: Network Hardware Security  
- `Sheet2`: LLM Security Knowledge Base

## 🔍 Security Check Design Task  

### Goal  
Design **practical and effective** internal network security checks, focusing on:

- Information Gathering  
- Vulnerability Scanning  
- Application Security  
- Host Security  
- Incident Response


## 🎯 Scoring Rules  

| Category | Max Score | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Knowledge Base | 80 pts | Based on model training & Q&A accuracy |
| Check Design | 20 pts | 1 pt per valid item, up to 50 |

🏁 **Final Score = max score from either round**  
🏅 **No tied ranks: shorter time wins on tie**
